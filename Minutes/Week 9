To do (week 9):
-	For each article in data folder: 
o	Store corresponding article images (graphs, data tables) 

-	Perform a qualitative analysis on some articles:
o	What is the intended message? 
"	What are the textual characteristics related to the visual representation described in the article
"	What are the key indicators?
o	E.g. indicators for a bar chart:
"	The graphic shows an increasing trend in the mean dollar value…… over the period from 2000 to 2005
