## Idea

Using news article data files and texts to predict it's optimal visual representation category, with use of a supervised learning approach. 

<br>

## To do



*	Perform a qualitative analysis on some articles:
    *	What is the intended message? 
          *	What are the textual characteristics related to the visual representation described in the article
              *	What are the key indicators?
              *	E.g. indicators for a bar chart:
                  *	The graphic shows an increasing trend in the mean dollar value…… over the period from 2000 to 2005







## In progress
*	Study of paper: Exploring the Types of Messages that Pie Charts Convey in Popular Media

## Done
*	On the homepage of my github I will generate an overview of my progress 
*	Github created: https://github.com/Mikevanlenthe/Master-thesis/
    *	Folder structure:
          *	Data: Article texts, csv files 
          *	Code: Used Python programs
          
*	For each article in data folder:
    *	Store corresponding article images (graphs, data tables) 

*	Data collected (so far)
    *	Scraped +- 80 FiveThirtyEight articles stored on github (folder "data")
          *	Each folder represents an unique article with:
          *	Corresponding csv files 
          *	Corresponding article text (in .txt format) 
          *	Link to article on FiveThirtyEight

*	Study of paper: Generating Textual Summaries of Bar Charts 
    *	Demir, S., Carberry, S., & McCoy, K. F. (2008, June). Generating textual summaries of bar charts. In Proceedings of the Fifth International Natural Language Generation Conference (pp. 7-15). Association for Computational Linguistics.


*	On github I will add a folder where I will store the weekly minutes
