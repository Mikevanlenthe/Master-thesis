## Idea

Using news article data files and texts to predict it's optimal visual representation category, with use of a supervised learning approach. 

<br>

## To do

*	For each article in data folder:
    *	Store corresponding article images (graphs, data tables) 

*	Perform a qualitative analysis on some articles:
    *	What is the intended message? 
          *	What are the textual characteristics related to the visual representation described in the article
              *	What are the key indicators?
              *	E.g. indicators for a bar chart:
                  *	The graphic shows an increasing trend in the mean dollar value…… over the period from 2000 to 2005


*	On github I will add a folder where I will store the weekly minutes

*	Study of paper: Exploring the Types of Messages that Pie Charts Convey in Popular Media
