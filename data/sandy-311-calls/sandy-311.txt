The (Very) Long Tail Of Hurricane Recovery
By Julia Wolfe and Oliver Roeder

On Sept. 8, someone in New York City dialed 311, the city’s non-emergency hotline, and asked for information about a Hurricane Sandy disaster relief program. This was not a fluke. It’s been nearly five years since the storm devastated the mid-Atlantic, causing 43 deaths in the city and $19 billion in damage. But still, nearly 1,800 days later, the calls continue — there have already been 142 this year. 1

As hurricanes Harvey and Irma left Texas and Florida, they too left devastation behind. Dozens are dead, and untold billions of dollars lost. The roads to recovery will be steep — and they will be very long.

Hurricane recovery lingers beyond the first few months of hard work. Power is restored, homes are rebuilt and kids head back to school. But “normal” — life as it was before the storm — may never fully be reached. From New York City’s Open Data website, we downloaded the logs of over 36 million calls placed to 311 from the days ahead of Sandy’s arrival, in the fall of 2012, through today. Nearly 80,000 were directly related to the storm, and they tell the story of tragedy and recovery in one city. It’s a story that continues to unfold in New York, and one that is only beginning in Texas and Florida.2

Sandy hit New York on the evening of Oct. 29, and on that date, the city received 8,054 calls explicitly related to the storm. Over the next eight weeks, it received tens of thousands more.

The calls kept coming ...

Emergency management
The city’s 311 line received over 1,000 Sandy-related calls in May 2013. Among them were 20 New Yorkers asking to volunteer with storm relief efforts, seven months after Sandy made landfall.

City Hall
In August 2013, 436 total calls came in. Those that were considered the purview of City Hall included requests for help in finding cars after the storm and for information on the city’s plans to spend its disaster recovery funds.

Water and sewer bills
In September 2014, of 126 total calls, 10 fell under the purview of the Department of Environmental Protection. Customers with severely damaged or destroyed property, for example, could request to have their water and sewer bills reviewed and potentially lowered.

Orders to vacate
After Sandy, the city placed red stickers on buildings that were considered unsafe to enter or occupy. In April 2014, two calls were made by property owners requesting info on the status of vacate orders.

Storm-related finances
In June 2014, the city received 289 storm-related calls. Over half fell under the purview of the Department of Finance and were largely about Sandy-related property tax relief.

Significant structural damage
In November 2015, 25 calls came in — four were requesting inspection or reinspection of structures that had major storm damage.

Community restoration
In May 2016, one-fifth of the calls were business owners and community members requesting information on Sandy-related grants and loans.

Fraud reports
Overall, 292 calls have been made to report fraud related to the storm. They started as soon as a month after Sandy and were still coming in nearly five years later. In 2017, there were three such calls each in May, June and July.

Lingering effects
This August, 13 New Yorkers called. Three were directed to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. They were calling about mental health services for children affected by the hurricane.
