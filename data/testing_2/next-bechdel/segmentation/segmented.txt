We pitted 50 movies against 12 new ways of measuring Hollywood’s gender imbalance.By Walt Hickey, Ella Koeze, Rachael Dottle and Gus WezerekGet the data on GithubPublished Dec. 21, 2017 at 11:15 AMThe Bechdel-Wallace Test — more commonly abbreviated to the Bechdel Test — asks two simple questions of a movie: Does it have at least two named female characters?1 And do those characters have at least one conversation that is not about a man?

Sentence nr: 1
A surprising number of films fail the test.

Sentence nr: 2
Although the test is punchy and has become pervasive, it doesn’t address the core inequalities in Hollywood films.

Sentence nr: 3
That isn’t a knock on the test.

Sentence nr: 4
Alison Bechdel — an acclaimed cartoonist who was awarded a MacArthur “genius” grant in 2014 and whose memoir was adapted into a Tony Award-winning musical — in no way set out to solve Hollywood sexism when she wrote the test into a comic strip in the mid-1980s.

Sentence nr: 5
Instead, she was drawing attention to the severity of the problem by showing how low you could set the bar and still watch Hollywood executives trip over it.

Sentence nr: 6
A third of the top 50 movies of 2016 failed the Bechdel TestStill, 30 years on, we’re not exactly sitting on a superior answer for measuring the movie industry’s gender imbalance.

Sentence nr: 7
What does the next Bechdel Test look like?

Sentence nr: 8
The time is ripe for a successor.

Sentence nr: 9
Is there a short, punchy test we can apply?

Sentence nr: 10
One that, if movies start passing it, would indicate that the industry is actually becoming better for both the women who make movies and the people who watch them?

Sentence nr: 11
Is there a new test that could pull the modern film business in the right direction?

Sentence nr: 12
And if there is, where on earth do we find it?

Sentence nr: 13
Here’s where we started: We reached out to more than a dozen women in film and television — writers, directors, actresses and producers — to ask what they think the next Bechdel Test should be.

Sentence nr: 14
The answers we got ran the gamut.

Sentence nr: 15
Some addressed representation behind the camera.

Sentence nr: 16
Others zeroed in on the problems faced by women of color.

Sentence nr: 17
Still others concentrated on characterization and story — how women are represented on screen.

Sentence nr: 18
In the end, we boiled their responses down into 11 tests from our film-industry sources — plus one from our staffers.

Sentence nr: 19
We then used The Numbers database to identify the 50 top-grossing films at the domestic box office in 20162 and ran them through all our new tests.

Sentence nr: 20
We split the 50 movies between nine FiveThirtyEight staffers, who watched each film with a clipboard, keeping track of all the things that our 12 tests were interested in.3 Every film was scored by two staffers, and any discrepancies in scoring were debated until we reached a consensus.

Sentence nr: 21
Hollywood does decently according to some tests — and absolutely abhorrently according to others.

Sentence nr: 22
Similarly, some films get OK marks — “Bad Moms,” “Hidden Figures” and “Independence Day: Resurgence” passed at least half of the 12 new tests.

Sentence nr: 23
Others did not.

Sentence nr: 24
“The Secret Life Of Pets,” “Deadpool,” “Doctor Strange” and “Rogue One” each passed only one new test.

Sentence nr: 25
All told, it’s clear after this exercise that Hollywood is failing an entire gender on several fronts.

Sentence nr: 26
Tests that look behind the camera Movies don’t just emerge fully formed from the ether; they’re the result of the labor of hundreds and often thousands of people.

Sentence nr: 27
Most of those people are men.

Sentence nr: 28
For example: The Annenberg Inclusion Initiative looked at 900 movies released over nine of the past 10 years4 and found that only 34 women had worked as directors on those films.

Sentence nr: 29
If women aren’t in key creative roles — say, if they’re being drummed out of the industry by pervasive, top-to-bottom sexism — then it’s not surprising that the resulting work is skewed.

Sentence nr: 30
In other words, for every gratuitous sexualizing shot of a woman in a film, there is (almost always) a guy deciding to shoot it that way.

Sentence nr: 31
So these three tests look at who makes the movies.

Sentence nr: 32
Kate Rees Davies, a director, wanted to make sure that not only was there a woman in each and every department, but also that there was a second woman to back the first one up.

Sentence nr: 33
Rory Uphold, an actress, wanted to see who was on set during filming, to see who was in the room when decisions got made.

Sentence nr: 34
Jen White, a cinematographer, has developed a tiered metric for judging the gender balance of a crew.5 These tests that look at the behind-the-scenes crew are among the least flattering for Hollywood.

Sentence nr: 35
And, in fact, the overwhelming maleness of film crews was repeatedly cited by most of the women interviewed for this story as a key cause of the issues they’ve experienced in the industry.

Sentence nr: 36
"To be honest, there’s no excuse for these kinds of numbers,” said Uphold.

Sentence nr: 37
“You want to stop sexual harassment in the workplace?

Sentence nr: 38
Hire more women.

Sentence nr: 39
End of story."

Sentence nr: 40
The Uphold TestRory Uphold: writer and actress on “This Is Why We’re Single”A movie passes if:The on-set crew is 50 percent women The Conjuring 2 By the numbersUsing names to estimate gender, “The Conjuring 2” was one of the worst offenders, with men accounting for about 90 percent of the crew.Show test notes“On-set crew” refers to directors, second-unit directors and assistant directors, as well as people working in the camera, electrical, cinematography, production management and sound departments.

Sentence nr: 41
We used Genderize.io to calculate the probability that the first name of all qualifying crew members belonged to a man, counting as a man any crew member whose name belongs to a man more than 90 percent of the time.

Sentence nr: 42
We also performed a secondary check: We summed up the probabilities that each crew member was male based on their first name and divided that by the total number of crew.

Sentence nr: 43
Since both those checks estimated that men accounted for more than 50 percent of every crew, all 50 movies failed.

Sentence nr: 44
In fact, even the best-performing films — “Arrival” and “Moana” — had on-set crews that we estimated to be over 60 percent male.

Sentence nr: 45
For these movies to get a “pass,” one in six of the people with names that are almost always masculine would have to be women.The Rees Davies TestKate Rees Davies: director and producerA movie passes if:Every department has two or more women Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice By the numbersEven though the movie passed this test, men made up an estimated 73 percent of the crew of “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.”Show test notesWe checked each department of each film to see if there were at least two people who had names that belonged to women 90 percent of the time or more.

Sentence nr: 46
If a department failed that test, we checked to see if at least two generally-but-not-definitely female names or two gender-ambiguous names appeared.

Sentence nr: 47
And if a department failed that test, we checked to see if all names in the department were most likely male (names that belonged to men at least half the time).

Sentence nr: 48
Films for which all departments passed the first check passed the Rees Davies test.

Sentence nr: 49
Films where at least one department failed the third check failed the test.

Sentence nr: 50
For the leftover films with departments that passed the middle check — and when that department was decisive in whether a film passed or failed the test — we went through the people in that department individually, looking on IMDb, LinkedIn and personal sites to ascertain if two women worked there.The White TestJen White: director of photography; International Cinematographers Guild memberA movie passes if:Half of the department heads are womenHalf the members of each department are womenAnd half the crew members are women Don’t Breathe By the numbersWhile still failing, “Don’t Breathe” approached parity, with men making up around 54 percent of the crew.Show test notesFor the White Test, a department head was defined as the person who could win the Academy Award for the position — essentially anyone billed as a production designer, set designer, art director, special effects supervisor, visual effects supervisor, editor, stunt coordinator, animation director or director of photography.

Sentence nr: 51
Plus, in the sound category, the production sound mixer, the re-recording mixer and the sound editor.

Sentence nr: 52
The costume, casting, hair and makeup departments were excluded.

Sentence nr: 53
Departmentally, this was determined using the same method we used for the Rees Davies Test, but with a 50 percent threshold rather than a two-woman threshold.

Sentence nr: 54
For movies that can’t pass the full test above, White also gave us standards for a “minimal pass” and a “moderate pass.” Movies get a minimal pass if they have one woman in each department and one woman serving as the head of a department other than casting, costumes, hair and makeup.

Sentence nr: 55
For perspective, 23 out of 50 films passed the minimal version of the White Test.

Sentence nr: 56
The moderate pass called for 30 percent of departmental heads and 30 percent of each department’s crew members to be women, but no films cleared those thresholds.Tests that look beyond white women When women do get a break in Hollywood, they tend to be white.

Sentence nr: 57
One study found that among the female leads and co-leads in the top 100 films6 of 2016, only three were members of an underrepresented racial or ethnic group.

Sentence nr: 58
And that figure was identical to 2015’s.

Sentence nr: 59
Young girls of color have a difficult time finding movie characters who look like them.

Sentence nr: 60
“I feel like we all deserve that,” said Lena Waithe, the actress and Emmy Award-winning writer.

Sentence nr: 61
“Everybody deserves to see positive — not positive, I’m not a big fan of that word — but accurate and layered and complex images of themselves.” These tests ask if films incorporate women of color at any level.

Sentence nr: 62
In writer and actress Naomi Ko’s test, it’s as simple as a looking for a non-white, English-speaking woman who talks in five or more scenes.

Sentence nr: 63
In Waithe’s test, it’s about a balanced portrayal.

Sentence nr: 64
About 18 percent of the country is Hispanic or Latino, but Hollywood failed a simple test, from producer and writer Ligiah Villalobos, that looks for Latinas in film.

Sentence nr: 65
“It is incredibly disappointing,” said Villalobos, “that we are at the end of 2017, that this country has over 50 million Latinos, and that these are the numbers relating to Latina characters in films.” The Waithe TestLena Waithe: Emmy Award-winning writer on “Master of None”A movie passes if:There’s a black woman in the workWho’s in a position of powerAnd she’s in a healthy relationship Ghostbusters The Peanut Gallery says:“Why did it have to be the black character who wasn’t the scientist?”Show test notesFor animated films, we checked IMDb and counted a character as a black woman if she was voiced by a black woman.

Sentence nr: 66
We counted a position of power as one in which a person exerted control over others or had at least one subordinate.The Ko TestNaomi Ko: writer; actress in “Dear White People”A movie passes if:There’s a non-white, female-identifying person in the filmWho speaks in five or more scenesAnd speaks English Zootopia The Peanut Gallery says:“Mrs.

Sentence nr: 67
Otterton is played by Octavia Spencer, so there is a non-white woman in the film.

Sentence nr: 68
On the other hand, she speaks in two scenes.”Show test notesSpeaking means dialogue, not fight grunts.

Sentence nr: 69
For animated films, we checked IMDb and counted a character as non-white if she was voiced by a non-white actor.

Sentence nr: 70
Originally, the test didn’t specify that the character had to speak English but rather asked if she spoke “in the language of the release,” but all the movies we watched were English-language anyway.The Villalobos TestLigiah Villalobos: producer; head writer of “Go, Diego, Go!”A movie passes if:The film has a Latina leadAnd the lead or another Latina character is shown as professional or college educated, speaks in unaccented English, and is not sexualized Zootopia The Peanut Gallery says:“‘Zootopia,’ has Shakira, but her character is sexualized.

Sentence nr: 71
How do you sexualize a deer?”Show test notesWe consulted IMDb to see if an actor identified as Hispanic or Latina in her bio.

Sentence nr: 72
In animated films, we looked at the voice actors.Tests that look at female protagonists These three tests — from director Kimberly Peirce, producer Lindsey Villarreal and writer Noga Landau — look at women as characters who have needs and desires and who take actions stemming from those desires over the course of the film.

Sentence nr: 73
(You know, they act like real people.)

Sentence nr: 74
A surprising number of films fail to do even that much basic character development work with women.

Sentence nr: 75
Often, women are reduced to stereotypes or tropes as soon as they’re introduced and then don’t get developed any further.

Sentence nr: 76
And female characters frequently serve little purpose beyond causing plot problems for male protagonists, or having a baby with a male protagonist, or dying to raise the stakes for a male protagonist.

Sentence nr: 77
The Peirce TestKimberly Peirce: director of “Boys Don’t Cry,” “Stop-Loss” and “Carrie”A movie passes if:There’s a female character who is a protagonist or antagonist with her own storyThe female lead has dimension and exists authentically with needs and desires that she pursues through dramatic actionAnd the audience can empathize with or understand the female lead’s desires and actions Pete’s Dragon The Peanut Gallery says:“It’s Pete’s dragon, not Grace’s dragon.”The Villarreal TestLindsey Villarreal: producer; assistant on “Mad Men,” “The Strain” and “Bates Motel”A movie fails if:A lead female character is introduced as one of three common stereotypes in her first scene: as sexualized; as hardened, expressionless or soulless; or as a matriarch (tired, older or overworked)But a failing movie can redeem itself and pass if the lead female character is later shown to be three or more of the following:Someone with a career where she is in a position of authority or powerA motherSomeone who’s reckless or makes bad decisionsSomeone who is sexual or chooses a sexual identity of her own The Secret Life of Pets The Peanut Gallery says:“I thought the cat was introduced as hardened, expressionless and soulless.”The Landau TestNoga Landau: writer for “The Magicians”A movie fails if:A primary female character ends up deadA primary female character ends up pregnantOr a primary female character causes a plot problem for a male protagonist Deadpool The Peanut Gallery says:“Vanessa causes a plot problem for Deadpool: She’s hot and he’s embarrassed about not being hot.”Show test notesAfter seeing the results, Landau suggested that “male protagonist” be amended to “male hero” to exclude male antiheroes.Tests that look at the supporting cast The Annenberg Inclusion Initiative looked at every speaking character in the 100 top-grossing films of 2016.

Sentence nr: 78
Only 31.4 percent of the 39,788 speaking characters were women.

Sentence nr: 79
One reason for that: The majority of supporting roles, one-scene parts and bits as extras go to men.

Sentence nr: 80
Does your protagonist report a crime to a cop?

Sentence nr: 81
Cop’s probably a man.

Sentence nr: 82
Do they get stitched up?

Sentence nr: 83
Doctor’s probably a man.

Sentence nr: 84
Their president’s probably a man, and the soldiers that he commands are likely men, too.

Sentence nr: 85
Kate Hagen first picked up on this while watching a lecture by Geena Davis.

Sentence nr: 86
“I had never considered how strange it was that most one-scene roles or small parts in film end up going to men by default,” said Hagen, the director of community at The Black List.7 “You can never un-see it.

Sentence nr: 87
The lack of women starts driving you mad.

Sentence nr: 88
The same goes for crowd scenes: If we're in New York City, why is the crowd 70 percent male and 80 percent white?” It may be easier for these oversights to slip through when women aren’t involved in key, high-level creative positions during the production of a film.

Sentence nr: 89
These three tests — from Hagen, two of our movie watchers, and director Rachel Feldman — look past the top-billed actors and study the industry’s systemic casting issues by examining supporting casts and the background players who populate the world that the stars inhabit.

Sentence nr: 90
The Hagen TestKate Hagen: director of community at the scriptwriter group The Black ListA movie passes if:Half of one-scene roles go to womenAnd the first crowd scene features at least 50 percent women Hacksaw Ridge The Peanut Gallery says:“First crowd scene is zero percent women.”Show test notesOne-scene characters were counted up by each watcher and scrutinized for gender.

Sentence nr: 91
To accommodate mildly different definitions of “one-scene character,” each movie-watching pair reconciled their list of one-scene roles to determine whether a movie passed or failed.

Sentence nr: 92
In animated films, the gender that IMDb listed for the voice actor was considered when other ways of determining gender failed.

Sentence nr: 93
A crowd was defined as any group in excess of 10 people.

Sentence nr: 94
For films with no crowds and films where it was impossible to determine the gender of any crowds, that requirement was excluded and the movie passed or failed solely on the percentage of one-scene roles that went to women.The Koeze-Dottle TestRachael Dottle and Ella Koeze: journalists — we helped do this projectA movie passes if:The supporting cast is 50 percent women The Magnificent Seven The Peanut Gallery says:“There were so many dusty men in this movie — too many to count.”Show test notesTwo of our frustrated movie-watchers came up with this test during the research process.

Sentence nr: 95
To conduct it, we pulled the gender of all actors billed as “supporting” — that is, not lead, lead ensemble or cameo parts — on OpusData, and counted up the gender breakdown among the highest-billed roles (either the half of the supporting cast that had the highest billing or the 10 highest-billed supporting roles, whichever number is lower).The Feldman ScoreRachel Feldman: director; former chair of the Directors Guild of America’s Women’s Steering CommitteeA movie passes with a score of five or higher:2 points for a female writer or director1 point for a female composer or director of photography1 point for three female producers or three female department heads1 point for a crew that’s 50 percent women2 points if there’s a female protagonist who determines story outcomes2 points if no female characters were victimized, stereotyped or sexualizedAnd 1 point if a sex scene shows foreplay before consummation, or if the female characters initiate or reciprocate sexual advances The Angry Birds Movie The Peanut Gallery says:“If she had had sex, that would have been the least offensive thing about this movie.”Show test notesWriters, directors, composers, producers and department heads were pulled from IMDb.

Sentence nr: 96
A department head was defined as the person who could win the Academy Award for the position.

Sentence nr: 97
Only those credited as “producer” — not “executive producer” or other adjective-modified producer — were counted toward the female producer quota.We need more than one test One test or metric isn’t going to change an entire industry that has top-to-bottom problems with giving women the opportunities that similarly qualified men get.

Sentence nr: 98
Indeed, even the tests we have here face serious real-world limitations, relying on our judgment calls in places and gender probabilities in others.

Sentence nr: 99
And many of these tests are scaled-back versions of ones that we would have loved to run if we’d had perfect information: We can’t reasonably ascertain the sexual orientation or race of 50,000 crew members, but many of the people we spoke to pitched us tests that included that information as one of their criteria.

Sentence nr: 100
Still, the trend we’ve identified here is strong, and the metrics used to gauge success or failure do make a difference.

Sentence nr: 101
We can’t understand where the industry is falling short until we determine what “short” means by giving ourselves a mark to measure against.

Sentence nr: 102
As a bare-minimum metric, the Bechdel Test does a good job of showing how amazingly far Hollywood is from gender equality.

Sentence nr: 103
But it isn’t going to push the industry toward an identifiable goal.

Sentence nr: 104
Many films that pass the Bechdel Test failed most of the new tests above.

Sentence nr: 105
In a time when Hollywood is beginning a cultural reckoning and certain abuses of power are getting the headlines and condemnation they’ve long deserved, it’s worth remembering the subtler and often more pervasive misogyny that empowers abusers and might be far more difficult to root out.
