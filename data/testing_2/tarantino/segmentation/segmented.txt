Dec. 9, 2015 at 10:29 AM A Complete Catalog Of Every Time Someone Cursed Or Bled Out In A Quentin Tarantino Movie By Oliver Roeder Filed under Word Count Get the data on GitHub GitHub data at data/tarantino FacebookTwitterEmail Quentin Tarantino, John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in “Pulp Fiction.” From the minute the multiplex curtains pulled back on his first feature, director Quentin Tarantino has ignited the interest, and occasional ire, of critics for his films’ strong language and frequent violence.

Sentence nr: 1
The New York Times called his first film, “Reservoir Dogs,” “aggressively brutal.” About his next film, “Pulp Fiction,” the Los Angeles Times wrote that there was “something wearing and repetitive about the film’s reliance on shock value and bad-boy posturing to maintain our attention.” Tarantino’s eighth feature film, “The Hateful Eight,” comes out on Christmas, and it’s the story of bounty hunters seeking refuge from a Wyoming blizzard after the Civil War — so basically “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” meets “Frozen.” To get ready, I spent a week on the couch with Tarantino’s oeuvre, watching people die and swear a blue streak.

Sentence nr: 2
When someone was killed by a gun or a sword or a venomous snake, or someone was called a “motherfucker” or a “cocksucker,” I made a note of the event and the time.

Sentence nr: 3
Then I did it all over again a few seconds later.

Sentence nr: 4
What resulted was hard-won data that showed me the essential tempos of Tarantino’s films, and how they’ve changed over time.1 The guy’s getting bloodier in his old age.

Sentence nr: 5
Some mild assumptions were necessary for this project.

Sentence nr: 6
For one, I’m not a medical doctor, but I assumed that if, say, someone had numerous limbs cut off or took a direct blade to the torso in a samurai sword battle, that person would indeed bleed out and die.2 And for profanity in foreign languages — mainly in Chinese and Japanese in the “Kill Bill” films and French in “Inglourious Basterds” — I relied on the theatrical subtitles.3 Also, it’s occasionally difficult to make out the profane language precisely.

Sentence nr: 7
If you recently had your one remaining eyeball plucked out, for example, I may not have understood every word you screamed in horror.

Sentence nr: 8
But I did my best to count all the curses, from the mild hells and damns and asses to the more potent shits, fucks and n-words.

Sentence nr: 12
1 57 63 0.9 Total 1704 190 9.0 Every Tarantino film features plenty of R-rated language4 and at least a few deaths, but they’re not all created equal.

Sentence nr: 13
Tarantino has been trading fucks for deaths as he “matures.” “Reservoir Dogs” features “just” 10 on-screen deaths, but 421 profanities.

Sentence nr: 14
“Django Unchained,” on the other hand, has “just” 262 profanities but 47 deaths.5 Part of this is probably his films’ growing budgets — it’s much cheaper to drop a dozen f-bombs on celluloid than to drop a dozen samurais.

Sentence nr: 15
If you want to jolt audiences on the cheap, you do it through swearing.

Sentence nr: 16
If you want to do it with a budget, you slice some people in half.

Sentence nr: 17
“Reservoir Dogs” was made for about $2 million in today’s dollars, per IMDb.

Sentence nr: 18
The “Django Unchained” budget was just more than $100 million.

Sentence nr: 19
“The Hateful Eight” cost $44 million.

Sentence nr: 21
2” there’s a remarkable 16-plus-minute stretch with no death or profanity at all.

Sentence nr: 22
Just regular talking and driving and stuff.

Sentence nr: 23
Some of it does take place with a pimp in a brothel and a facially scarred prostitute, but still.

Sentence nr: 24
And when it comes to curses, we’re in the quietest era of his filmography.

Sentence nr: 25
Although Tarantino is an eclectic profaner, using healthy doses of words from the carnal to the scatological, he’s especially fond of expletives of the “F” variety.

Sentence nr: 26
Tarantino doesn’t give a fuck — he gives hundreds.

Sentence nr: 27
“Fuck” is a fantastic word.

Sentence nr: 28
It might be the very best word.

Sentence nr: 29
It might be the single most useful word in the English language.

Sentence nr: 30
It’s a transitive verb and an intransitive verb.

Sentence nr: 31
It’s a noun and an interjection.

Sentence nr: 32
“Fucking” can be an adjective and an intensifier and a gerund.6 “Fucked” can also be an adjective, with an altogether different meaning.

Sentence nr: 33
And “fuck,” with all of its deliciously vulgar varietals, is Tarantino’s favorite.

Sentence nr: 34
TYPE OF FUCK COUNT % OF ALL FUCKS fucking 407 52.7% fuck 213 27.6 motherfucker 70 9.1 motherfucking 27 3.5 fucked 25 3.2 motherfuckers 15 1.9 fucker 8 1.0 fucks 3 0.4 fuckup 1 0.1 fuckhead 1 0.1 fuckface 1 0.1 fuckers 1 0.1 Total fucks 772 100.0 The table next to this paragraph breaks down all the inflections of fuck uttered in Tarantino’s films, from the earliest utterance in “Reservoir Dogs” — “She’s been fucked over a few times” — to the last in “Django Unchained” — “You done fucked up.” “Fucking,” with its evergreen, yogic flexibility, earns the top spot.

Sentence nr: 35
A typical Tarantino deployment of the word, courtesy of Vincent Vega in the back seat of a brain-and-skull-spattered car in “Pulp Fiction”: “Right now I’m a fucking race car, and you got me in the red, and I’m just saying that it’s fucking dangerous to have a race car in the fucking red, that’s all.” “The Hateful Eight” may not continue this proud tradition.

Sentence nr: 36
A leaked script for the movie reportedly had, as Esquire magazine put it, “a paltry 18 fucks.” (My search of the script revealed 23 versions of the word.)

Sentence nr: 37
If the theatrical release is consistent with the leaked script, and there’s no guarantee that it will be, “Hateful Eight” will nearly be the most fuckless Tarantino film.

Sentence nr: 38
2003’s “Kill Bill: Vol.

Sentence nr: 39
1” had 17 versions of the f-bomb, according to my tally.

Sentence nr: 40
By my count, the leaked “Hateful Eight” script also contains 11 versions of “shit,” 14 of “bitch,” 16 of “hell,” 21 of “ass,” 44 of “damn” and 49 n-words.

Sentence nr: 41
On the profanity gauge, this would be a significant downtick from his last film, and a far cry from the early days of “Reservoir Dogs,” “Pulp Fiction” and “Jackie Brown.” Given how Tarantino has eased back on his obscenities, one could be forgiven for feeling nostalgic for Tarantino’s early, hyper-potty-mouthed days.

Sentence nr: 42
“Dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,” the character Mr. Brown, played by Tarantino himself, explains over coffee in the very first scene of Tarantino’s very first feature, “Reservoir Dogs.” “How many dicks is that?” Mr. Blue deadpans.

Sentence nr: 43
“A lot,” says Mr. White.

Sentence nr: 44
Or, to be exact, nine out of the 20 dicks in Tarantino’s full catalog.
