27, 2015 at 6:07 AM Some Democrats Who Could Step Up If Hillary Isn’t Ready For Hillary By Harry Enten Filed under 2016 Election Get the data on GitHub GitHub data at data/democratic-bench FacebookTwitterEmail Sen. Sherrod Brown and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, then assistant to the president and special adviser to the Treasury Secretary, in 2011.

Sentence nr: 2
Tom Williams / Roll Call Hillary Clinton is probably going to run for president, and she’s probably going to be the Democratic nominee in 2016.

Sentence nr: 3
Both those things are likely.

Sentence nr: 4
But let’s say Clinton falters — some major scandal comes to light, or she has health problems.

Sentence nr: 5
Who could step in?

Sentence nr: 6
Martin O’Malley, Bernie Sanders and Jim Webb are preparing for such a possibility.

Sentence nr: 7
But they’re not exactly political powerhouses, and so we come to another question: Is the Democratic bench really that weak?

Sentence nr: 8
One way to look at that question is via fundraising.

Sentence nr: 9
A late entrant in 2016 would need to raise money quickly, and the ability to raise money is a decent proxy for appeal and organizing strength.

Sentence nr: 10
It’s part of the reason Elizabeth Warren is thought of as such a powerful force in the Democratic Party.

Sentence nr: 11
She raised over $42 million in her 2012 bid for Senate.

Sentence nr: 12
Warren’s is a clear case, but simple fundraising numbers don’t always tell the whole story.

Sentence nr: 13
Factors such as whether a candidate is running for statewide or federal office, whether she’s an incumbent, the competitiveness of her election1 and the size of her home-state donor base2 all affect fundraising.

Sentence nr: 14
Keeping all these variables in mind, I looked at how much Democratic governors and senators who won their last campaign raised during the 2010, 2012 and 2014 cycles and who outperformed their expected fundraising totals.

Sentence nr: 15
Besides Democratic Party leaders in the Senate — such as former Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chair Bob Menendez, Minority Leader Harry Reid and Vice Chairman of the Senate Democratic Caucus Chuck Schumer — many of the candidates who greatly outperformed fundraising expectations are the ones we normally talk about as contenders for the presidency.

Sentence nr: 16
<bar>Here’s the data in full.

Sentence nr: 17
And here are the top 25 Democrats who beat expectations: CANDIDATE EXPECTED AMOUNT RAISED ACTUAL AMOUNT RAISED DIFFERENCE Elizabeth Warren $24.4m $42.5m +$18.1m Andrew Cuomo 30.7 48.0 +17.3 Al Franken 17.2 30.8 +13.6 Harry Reid 13.6 24.8 +11.2 Sherrod Brown 18.1 24.8 +6.8 Bob Menendez 10.7 17.3 +6.7 Chuck Schumer 13.4 19.5 +6.1 Deval Patrick 11.8 16.3 +4.5 Jeanne Shaheen 12.2 16.5 +4.3 Claire McCaskill 17.0 21.1 +4.1 Bob Casey 10.7 14.1 +3.5 Tammy Baldwin 11.3 14.6 +3.4 Chris Murphy 7.6 10.5 +3.0 Joe Donnelly 2.8 5.7 +2.8 Mazie Hirono 2.8 5.5 +2.8 Patty Murray 14.8 17.1 +2.4 Kirsten Gillibrand 13.4 15.7 +2.3 Jeff Merkley 10.0 12.0 +2.0 Cory Booker 16.2 17.7 +1.5 Earl Ray Tomblin 6.2 7.7 +1.4 Jon Tester 12.0 13.4 +1.4 Mike Beebe 3.7 5.1 +1.4 Steve Beshear 9.5 10.6 +1.1 John Kitzhaber 4.2 5.3 +1.1 Brian Schatz 5.1 6.1 +1.0 Warren, Andrew Cuomo and Deval Patrick are all unlikely to run in 2016, but they’ve been included in a lot of polls.

Sentence nr: 18
And all three have been prolific fundraisers.

Sentence nr: 19
Warren raised over $18 million more than expected.

Sentence nr: 20
Cuomo and Patrick were also among the top performers, even after controlling for their wealthy East Coast donor bases.</bar> Two names popped up, though, that were more surprising.

Sentence nr: 21
Senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Al Franken of Minnesota both raised a lot more money in their 2012 and 2014 campaigns, respectively, than we might have expected.

Sentence nr: 22
Would they be running in 2016 if Clinton wasn’t?

Sentence nr: 23
Some journalists have, in fact, wondered why Brown doesn’t run.

Sentence nr: 24
He’s seen as a darling of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, and he’s managed to win two terms in Ohio, a crucial swing state.

Sentence nr: 25
Franken, too, has been the subject of a bit of presidential speculation.

Sentence nr: 26
He easily won re-election in Minnesota, not an overwhelmingly blue state, in 2014, a very tough year for Democrats nationally.

Sentence nr: 27
And he wouldn’t be the first actor-turned-politician to make a run for the White House.

Sentence nr: 28
Going down the list: a number of well-known and relatively young Democrats such as Tammy Baldwin, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Chris Murphy all exceeded fundraising expectations by more than $1 million in their last bids for office.

Sentence nr: 29
Booker and Gillibrand did so despite having far less than a full term to raise money.

Sentence nr: 30
All four have been the subject of at least a little White House talk.

Sentence nr: 31
Overall, Democrats have several people on the bench first in line to step in on the national stage.

Sentence nr: 32
Chances are that won’t happen in 2016.

Sentence nr: 33
But given their age, Baldwin, Booker, Gillibrand and Murphy in particular are young enough that we could see them run in future races.
