Sentence nr: 1
Every week, I offer up problems related to the things we hold dear around here: math, logic and probability.

Sentence nr: 2
There are two types: Riddler Express for those of you who want something bite-sized and Riddler Classic for those of you in the slow-puzzle movement.

Sentence nr: 3
Submit a correct answer for either,1 and you may get a shoutout in next week‚Äôs column.

Sentence nr: 4
If you need a hint, or if you have a favorite puzzle collecting dust in your attic, find me on Twitter.

Sentence nr: 5
Riddler Express From Abijith Krishnan, a simple but intriguing participatory problem: Submit a positive integer.

Sentence nr: 6
The person who submits the lowest unique number among all submissions is the winner and is inducted into the exclusive üèÖ Ordinal Order üèÖ of Riddler Nation!

Sentence nr: 7
Submit your number Riddler Classic From Itay Bavly, a chain-link number problem: You start with the integers from one to 100, inclusive, and you want to organize them into a chain.

Sentence nr: 8
The only rules for building this chain are that you can only use each number once and that each number must be adjacent in the chain to one of its factors or multiples.

Sentence nr: 9
For example, you might build the chain: 4, 12, 24, 6, 60, 30, 10, 100, 25, 5, 1, 97 You have no numbers left to place after 97, leaving you with a finished chain of length 12.

Sentence nr: 10
What is the longest chain you can build?

Sentence nr: 11
Extra credit: What if you started with more numbers, e.g., one through 1,000?

Sentence nr: 13
In a certain town, 11 fine folks are running in a primary for three at-large seats on the City Commission.

Sentence nr: 14
Each voter may vote for up to three candidates.

Sentence nr: 15
This election will reduce the field of candidates from 11 to six.

Sentence nr: 16
How many different (legal) ways may a voter cast his or her ballot?

Sentence nr: 17
And how many different outcomes (excluding ties) are there for who advances to November‚Äôs general election?

Sentence nr: 18
Let‚Äôs start by separating out the number of candidates a voter is capable of voting for.

Sentence nr: 19
They can vote for three, two, one or zero.

Sentence nr: 20
If they vote for three candidates, there are ‚Äú11 choose 3,‚Äù or 165, ways to select them.

Sentence nr: 21
If they vote for two, there are ‚Äú11 choose 2,‚Äù or 55, ways to select them.

Sentence nr: 22
If they vote for only one, there are 11 ways to choose that candidate.

Sentence nr: 23
And there‚Äôs just one way to vote for zero candidates.

Sentence nr: 24
Adding all that up gives 232 possible ballots.

Sentence nr: 25
As for which candidates advance to November‚Äôs general election, there are 11 candidates and six slots, and ‚Äú11 choose 6‚Äù equals 462 outcomes.

Solution to last week‚Äôs Riddler Classic Congratulations to üëè Josiah Jenkins üëè of Rugby, North Dakota, winner of the previous Classic puzzle!

Sentence nr: 27
There are two warlords: you and your archenemy, with whom you‚Äôre competing to conquer castles and collect the most victory points.

Sentence nr: 28
Each of the 10 castles has its own strategic value for a would-be conqueror.

Sentence nr: 29
Specifically, the castles are worth 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶ , 9 and 10 victory points.

Sentence nr: 30
You and your enemy each have 100 soldiers to distribute between any of the 10 castles.

Sentence nr: 31
Whoever sends more soldiers to a given castle conquers that castle and wins its victory points.

Sentence nr: 32
(If you each send the same number of troops, you split the points.)

Sentence nr: 33
Whoever ends up with the most points wins.

Sentence nr: 34
But now, you have a spy!

Sentence nr: 35
You know how many soldiers your archenemy will send to each castle.

Sentence nr: 36
The bad news, though, is that you no longer have 100 soldiers ‚Äî your army suffered some losses in a previous battle.

Sentence nr: 37
How many soldiers do you need to have in order to win, no matter the distribution of your opponent‚Äôs soldiers?

Sentence nr: 38
You need 56 soldiers.

Sentence nr: 39
The 10 castles are worth a total of 1 + 2 + ‚Ä¶ + 9 + 10 = 55 points, meaning you need at least 28 victory points to win.

Sentence nr: 40
Solver Jack Markley provided an excellent description of the intuition behind the solution: Since we will have all the knowledge in this battle, we really just need to figure out what the most effective strategy for our enemy would be and then how many soldiers we need to win in that case.

Sentence nr: 41
War, like everything else involving people who want things, is ruled by economics.

Sentence nr: 42
My enemy doesn‚Äôt want us to get 28 or more points, so they want to make it cost as much as possible ‚Äî they want to make every castle give an equally poor number of points per soldier required to conquer it.

Sentence nr: 43
Luckily for my desire to deal with even numbers, 100 is the perfect number of soldiers so that the enemy sets up every castle as requiring two soldiers spent per victory point won with a distribution of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19 soldiers.

Sentence nr: 44
With that being the worst distribution for me, I can still win with 56 soldiers by conquering Castles 1 through 7 with a distribution of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 ‚Äî for exactly 28 victory points.

Sentence nr: 45
Solvers Daniel Eriksson and Zack Segel approached the problem using a technique called simulated annealing and were kind enough to share their code and graphs.

Sentence nr: 46
In the image below, you can see how Daniel‚Äôs simulations converged to Jack‚Äôs mathematical argument about the enemy‚Äôs troop distribution above.

Sentence nr: 47
As the program attempts to find the best distribution to combat your spy, it eventually arrives, after about 8,000 iterations, at the band of bars representing the 1, 3, 5, ‚Ä¶ soldier distribution described above: It‚Äôs good to have a spy!
