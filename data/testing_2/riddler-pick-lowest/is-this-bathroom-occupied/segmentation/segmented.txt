Sentence nr: 2
Every week, I offer up problems related to the things we hold dear around here: math, logic and probability.

Sentence nr: 3
There are two types: Riddler Express for those of you who want something bite-sized and Riddler Classic for those of you in the slow-puzzle movement.

Sentence nr: 4
Submit a correct answer for either,1 and you may get a shoutout in next week’s column.

Sentence nr: 5
If you need a hint, or if you have a favorite puzzle collecting dust in your attic, find me on Twitter.

Sentence nr: 6
Riddler Express From Chris Thornett, a special game of hot potato: A class of 30 children is playing a game where they all stand in a circle along with their teacher.

Sentence nr: 7
The teacher is holding two things: a coin and a potato.

Sentence nr: 8
The game progresses like this: The teacher tosses the coin.

Sentence nr: 9
Whoever holds the potato passes it to the left if the coin comes up heads and to the right if the coin comes up tails.

Sentence nr: 10
The game ends when every child except one has held the potato, and the one who hasn’t is declared the winner.

Sentence nr: 11
How do a child’s chances of winning change depending on where they are in the circle?

Sentence nr: 12
In other words, what is each child’s win probability?

Sentence nr: 13
Submit your answer Riddler Classic From Dave Moran, a puzzle perfect for your next work break: There is a bathroom in your office building that has only one toilet.

Sentence nr: 14
There is a small sign stuck to the outside of the door that you can slide from “Vacant” to “Occupied” so that no one else will try the door handle (theoretically) when you are inside.

Sentence nr: 15
Unfortunately, people often forget to slide the sign to “Occupied” when entering, and they often forget to slide it to “Vacant” when exiting.

Sentence nr: 16
Assume that 1/3 of bathroom users don’t notice the sign upon entering or exiting.

Sentence nr: 17
Therefore, whatever the sign reads before their visit, it still reads the same thing during and after their visit.

Sentence nr: 18
Another 1/3 of the users notice the sign upon entering and make sure that it says “Occupied” as they enter.

Sentence nr: 19
However, they forget to slide it to “Vacant” when they exit.

Sentence nr: 20
The remaining 1/3 of the users are very conscientious: They make sure the sign reads “Occupied” when they enter, and then they slide it to “Vacant” when they exit.

Sentence nr: 21
Finally, assume that the bathroom is occupied exactly half of the time, all day, every day.

Sentence nr: 22
Two questions about this workplace situation: If you go to the bathroom and see that the sign on the door reads “Occupied,” what is the probability that the bathroom is actually occupied?

Sentence nr: 23
If the sign reads “Vacant,” what is the probability that the bathroom actually is vacant?

Sentence nr: 24
Extra credit: What happens as the percentage of conscientious bathroom users changes?

Sentence nr: 25
Submit your answer Solution to last week’s Riddler Express Congratulations to 🏅 Mitchell Breitbart 🏅 of Cambridge, Massachusetts, winner of last week’s Express puzzle and the inaugural inductee into the Ordinal Order of Riddler Nation!

Sentence nr: 26
Last week, you were asked to submit a positive integer.

Sentence nr: 27
The person who submitted the lowest unique number among all submissions won.

Sentence nr: 28
The winning number was 85.

Sentence nr: 29
Mitchell explained his choice thus: The number was high enough that it wouldn’t be too popular, and the fact that it ended in a “5” makes it a round number in a certain way, which other submitters might think to avoid.

Sentence nr: 30
The logic worked.

Sentence nr: 31
Here’s how the nearly 4,000 submissions broke down (zooming in a bit to see just those less than 300): As arbiter of Riddler Nation, in this induction process I excluded a small set of spammers, including “Arthur from Louisville,” who submitted every single number up to 218 before, apparently, getting bored.

Sentence nr: 32
Solution to last week’s Riddler Classic Congratulations to 👏 James Medhurst 👏 of Birmingham, England, winner of last week’s Classic puzzle!

Sentence nr: 33
You start with the integers from one to 100, inclusive, and you want to organize them into a chain.

Sentence nr: 34
The only rules for building this chain are that you can only use each number once and that each number must be adjacent in the chain to one of its factors or multiples.

Sentence nr: 35
For example, you might build the chain 4, 12, 24, 6, 60, 30, 10, 100, 25, 5, 1, 97.

Sentence nr: 36
You have no numbers left to place after 97, leaving you with a finished chain of length 12.

Sentence nr: 37
What is the longest chain you can build?

Sentence nr: 38
It seems to be 77 numbers long.

Sentence nr: 39
This was a tough one.

Sentence nr: 40
It’s essentially a “longest path” problem, where the path you’re trying to find is from one number to another to another, with no repeat numbers, and where two numbers are only connected if they are each other’s factor or multiple.

Sentence nr: 41
Isar Bhattacharjee sent along this illustration: Problems like this, in general, are called NP-hard — this means there aren’t any known algorithms that can solve it quickly or easily.

Sentence nr: 42
One solver ran 30 million trials and topped out at a chain of length 55.

Sentence nr: 43
There does not appear to be a clever pen-and-paper approach, either, beyond taking educated guesses at what might turn into long chains.

Sentence nr: 44
But others found computational methods that took them farther down the path.

Sentence nr: 45
Here’s our winner James’s 77-number-long chain, for example: 93, 31, 62, 1, 87, 29, 58, 2, 92, 46, 23, 69, 3, 57, 19, 38, 76, 4, 68, 34, 17, 85, 5, 35, 70, 10, 100, 50, 25, 75, 15, 45, 90, 30, 60, 20, 40, 80, 16, 64, 32, 96, 48, 24, 12, 6, 78, 26, 52, 13, 91, 7, 49, 98, 14, 56, 28, 84, 42, 21, 63, 9, 81, 27, 54, 18, 36, 72, 8, 88, 44, 22, 66, 33, 99, 11, 55 And here’s solver Anders Kaseorg’s: 62, 31, 93, 3, 69, 23, 46, 92, 4, 76, 38, 19, 95, 5, 65, 13, 52, 26, 78, 6, 48, 96, 32, 64, 16, 80, 10, 70, 35, 7, 49, 98, 14, 56, 28, 84, 42, 21, 63, 9, 81, 27, 54, 18, 36, 72, 24, 12, 60, 30, 90, 45, 15, 75, 25, 50, 100, 20, 40, 8, 88, 44, 22, 66, 33, 99, 11, 55, 1, 87, 29, 58, 2, 68, 34, 17, 85 Other submitters offered arguments that longer chains existed, but none of these arguments were mathematically convincing, and no examples longer than 77 were submitted.

Sentence nr: 46
Anders found his chain using a small program written in clingo, a language created to solve combinatorial problems, and claimed the program found it to be optimal.

Sentence nr: 47
Others found their 77s using SageMath or MATLAB.

Sentence nr: 48
For extra credit, I called for chains built from the numbers 1 through 1,000.

Sentence nr: 49
Anders found a specific chain 418 numbers long, although cautioned that that may not be the biggest there can be.
