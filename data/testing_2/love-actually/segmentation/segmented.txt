Sentence nr: 2
Universal Pictures “Love Actually,” the 2003 film that launched a generation of cinematic hot takes, is the story of nine interconnected relationships in the weeks ahead of Christmas in the United Kingdom.

Sentence nr: 3
They’re united not just in their relationships but also by Heathrow Airport, a third space that bookends the film and is used by lowly tourists and prime ministers alike.

Sentence nr: 6
Yet by the time the credits roll, you may not have learned much about the titular emotion.

Sentence nr: 7
To get to the bottom of this intricately structured Christmas classic, we watched the film and ruthlessly coded scenes — how long they were, who was in them, who spoke to whom — and pulled a big pile of box office data to figure out what happened to all of these nice, attractive actors after they wrapped up this movie that makes us all cry.

Sentence nr: 8

Sentence nr: 12
Still, it’s the actor who played Sammo’s step-father whose post-“Love Actually” movies have made the most money.

Sentence nr: 13

Sentence nr: 14
That awful parenting, though, led to an outstanding and lucrative franchise.

Sentence nr: 28
Over in London B: Cracks appear in the bourgeois life that Thompson’s character leads when her husband, played by Rickman, finds that his new secretary likes to vamp around whispering things like “it’s all for you, sir.” Or how about a classic tale of boy-meets-and-ogles-girl-who-works-for-him?

Sentence nr: 38

Sentence nr: 39
