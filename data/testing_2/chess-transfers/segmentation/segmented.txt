American Chess Is Great Again A wealthy patron and a trio of grandmasters are coming for Bobby Fischer’s legacy.

Sentence nr: 1
By Oliver Roeder Filed under Chess Get the data on GitHub GitHub data at data/chess-transfers Published Aug. 8, 2017 FacebookTwitterEmail Photo illustration by FiveThirtyEight Wilhelm Steinitz was “a fat phlegmatic little man, with a fine forehead and mussed hair and clothes,” according to one newspaper account.

Sentence nr: 2
He was also the favorite at the inaugural world chess championship, held in 1886, and an émigré to the United States — Steinitz had adopted the U.S. as his own after emigrating from Europe, later changing his first name to William.

Sentence nr: 3
The championship match was a grand tour of the country, beginning in New York, ending in New Orleans, and stopping in St. Louis in between.

Sentence nr: 4
With $4,000 on the line, Steinitz struggled in the early games and fell far behind.

Sentence nr: 5
But by the time they reached New Orleans, he had recovered, and America’s first chess champion was crowned.

Sentence nr: 6
“It was from Steinitz that the era of modern chess began,” wrote Garry Kasparov, possibly the best player of all time.

Sentence nr: 7
But American chess was in the midst of a bleak century, only rarely punctuated by triumph.

Sentence nr: 8
Paul Morphy, the great chess genius and Steinitz’s unofficial predecessor, died of a stroke in the bath at age 47, just a couple of years before Steinitz won.

Sentence nr: 9
Contemporary reports described him as “insane,” walking the streets “chattering to himself.” Steinitz died, penniless and mentally ill, in a state hospital in 1900.

Sentence nr: 10
Bobby Fischer, the only modern American world champion, failed to defend his title in 1975, descended into paranoia and anti-Semitism, and later praised the terrorist attacks of 9/11.

Sentence nr: 11
Since Fischer’s exit, no American has ever been ranked the world No.

Sentence nr: 12
1.

Sentence nr: 13
Only two Americans — Fischer and Gata Kamsky — have played in the world championship finals in the last 100 years.

Sentence nr: 14
But this string of misfortune may be about to end, thanks to some quintessentially American ideals: mobility and prosperity.

Sentence nr: 15
A trio of players — both native and immigrant — have found their way to the U.S., and each now ranks in the top seven in the world.1 Those three, along with the reigning Norwegian world champion, are currently assembled in St. Louis for one of the strongest chess competitions ever held.

Sentence nr: 16
And that American city has become a lighthouse for the game, featuring top-flight tournaments, world-class venues and varsity chess programs.

Sentence nr: 17
And fueling it all is an aging multimillionaire who has made the success of American chess his life’s quest after growing up in an orphanage and falling in love with the game as a teenager.

Sentence nr: 18
Can the American dream be leveraged into chess glory?

Sentence nr: 19
Wilhelm Steinitz, right, was a chess great who adopted the U.S. as his own after emigrating from Europe.

Sentence nr: 20
Getty Images In April, two American grandmasters stood over the shoulder of a third, watching him struggle through a winnable tournament.

Sentence nr: 21
Hikaru Nakamura (current world No.

Sentence nr: 22
7), stood with his arms crossed beneath his floppy dark hair and sideburns.

Sentence nr: 23
Fabiano Caruana (world No.

Sentence nr: 24
3), sparrowlike and wearing a white dress shirt, stood next to him, squinting, with his arms gathered leisurely behind his back.

Sentence nr: 25
They are two of the three best chess players in the country, and all were vying for the title of national champion.

Sentence nr: 26
Seated in front of them was the other, commanding a black wooden army of pieces, Wesley So.

Sentence nr: 27
As the tournament, which stretched from March 29 to April 9, reached its crescendo, So sat at the board bundled in an eggplant-colored sweater while tied for first place.

Sentence nr: 28
Tied?

Sentence nr: 29
He should’ve been crushing this field, and he knew it.

Sentence nr: 30
He’s the next great hope, after all — the top-rated American and the world No.

Sentence nr: 31
2.

Sentence nr: 32
He still found his way through the remaining games, and held on to win the national championship a couple of days later — his first.

Sentence nr: 33
So has an acutely poised approach to a game of chess.

Sentence nr: 34
His arms hang at his sides.

Sentence nr: 35
He clasps his hands, left fingers over right, on the table in front of him.

Sentence nr: 36
He hovers over the wooden battle unfolding on the board, like the figurehead on the prow of a ship.

Sentence nr: 37
The USS So.

Sentence nr: 38
Occasionally, if the position is difficult, the USS So takes a hard turn starboard, and the grandmaster stares at the wall and ponders.

Sentence nr: 39
Every so often, if that doesn’t work, the ship turns port, toward the spectators.

Sentence nr: 40
Rarer still, he stares right at you.

Sentence nr: 41
So is a recent addition to an elite American lineup that now boasts three of the world’s top seven players.

Sentence nr: 42
The three found themselves in St. Louis on that sunny spring day — and playing under the American flag — in very American ways.

Sentence nr: 43
Nakamura wasn’t born here (he was born in Japan), but he moved here when he was 2 years old.

Sentence nr: 44
Caruana was born here (in Florida), but moved away (Spain, Hungary, Switzerland) to train.

Sentence nr: 45
So wasn’t born here either (Philippines), but moved here (Missouri) to attend college.

Sentence nr: 46
It’s not easy to describe what makes So’s game unique — or Caruana’s or Nakamura’s, for that matter.

Sentence nr: 47
The difficulty arises not only from chess’s vastness, but also from the creeping influence of computers.

Sentence nr: 48
Chess is a more homogenized game than it once was.

Sentence nr: 49
“It’s harder to differentiate the thinking of the different players because they’re all using the same programs,” John Donaldson, an international master who captained the U.S. team to a 2016 Olympiad win, said in a phone call.

Sentence nr: 50
That being said, some differences do remain.

Sentence nr: 51
Caruana and Nakamura have very aggressive styles, and Donaldson said occasionally they have to remind themselves to temper this aggression.

Sentence nr: 52
But a more placid temperament comes naturally to So, and it’s precisely this cool on the board that distinguishes him.

Sentence nr: 53
His play is consistent, calm and highly theoretical.

Sentence nr: 54
Unlike the world champion, Magnus Carlsen, who is known for not being especially well prepared when it comes to his opening moves, So takes theoretically established lines and adds in his own fresh strategic ideas.

Sentence nr: 55
The three U.S. players’ journeys to the precipice of a world championship have differed, too, but all have been long and some occasionally scandalous.

Sentence nr: 56
But all hope they’ll end with a world title.

Sentence nr: 57
Nakamura, 29, is the old hand.

Sentence nr: 58
He first clinched the country’s No.

Sentence nr: 59
1 spot in 2005, and has suffered the Fischer comparisons for years now.

Sentence nr: 60
“There are very few people out there who have the ability to, I don’t want to say change the world, but make a very big impact, and with chess I feel like I really have that chance,” Nakamura told the Riverfront Times in 2011.

Sentence nr: 61
So came next, switching his chess allegiances from the Filipino team to the U.S. in 2014.

Sentence nr: 62
(At the time, he was No.

Sentence nr: 63
14 in the world.)

Sentence nr: 64
Caruana, 25, followed shortly after, defecting from the Italian squad in 2015.

Sentence nr: 65
“I think I will be world champion someday,” Caruana told The New Yorker.

Sentence nr: 66
<bar> More players transfer to the U.S. than to any other country Nations that received the highest number of player transfers, 2000-17 COUNTRY NUMBER OF TRANSFERS 1 United States 89 – 2 Germany 55 – 3 Canada 44 – 4 Spain 41 – 5 Russia 36 – 6 France 34 – 7 Bosnia and Herzegovina 32 – 8 Croatia 32 – 9 Turkey 31 – 10 Austria 29 – </bar> 2017 data as of April 11.

Sentence nr: 67
Source: FIDE Caruana and So’s transfers did not go unnoticed.

Sentence nr: 68
Caruana’s transfer required a fee of $61,000, paid to the Italians and FIDE, the game’s international governing body.

Sentence nr: 69
According to the Italian Chess Federation, Caruana was also offered more than $200,000 a year by the Americans.

Sentence nr: 70
Some top players, including Carlsen, scoffed at what they saw as a mercenary approach to building an American roster.

Sentence nr: 71
probably need an even better squad to go further though, wonder if Caruana and So are still for sale — Magnus Carlsen (@MagnusCarlsen) September 13, 2016 The U.S.

Sentence nr: 72
Chess Federation recognizes its role in building the American roster this way, but is shy with details.

Sentence nr: 73
“We get involved because a player of So’s stature carries with it some heavy funding requirements,” its president Gary Walters told me.

Sentence nr: 74
“FIDE has penalties when you cross and change flags … When you’re Wesley So, we’re talking about tens of thousands of euros to make the transfer.

Sentence nr: 75
That money has to be paid through U.S.

Sentence nr: 76
Chess … We typically do not make the payments for players, but we will facilitate the payments.” (FIDE lists So’s transfer fee at 5,000 euros.)

Sentence nr: 77
The federation operates with a total annual revenue of about $3.8 million in 2015, according to its tax documents.

Sentence nr: 78
Who did pay?

Sentence nr: 79
“I don’t know who paid the transfer fees,” Walters said.

Sentence nr: 80
The New York Times reported that the United States Chess Federation had created a charitable fund “to help recruit and pay the fees of foreign players interested in moving to the United States.” So has said he paid the fee out of pocket.

Sentence nr: 81
Despite their far-flung origins, the American players have, as a group, achieved early success.

Sentence nr: 82
The U.S. won gold at the Olympiad, the top team chess competition, last year.

Sentence nr: 83
It was the first time the country had taken gold in 40 years.

Sentence nr: 84
But the triad aren’t close, and remain professional rivals.

Sentence nr: 85
At the closing ceremonies after the nationals, as Nakamura nursed a beer at a ballroom table in St. Louis waiting for So to receive his trophy, Nakamura explained to me that his friends generally aren’t top chess players.

Sentence nr: 86
They’re his competition, after all.

Sentence nr: 87
I also asked So, over email, if he had good friends in the chess world.

Sentence nr: 88
“No.

Sentence nr: 89
This is not a team sport,” he responded.

Sentence nr: 90
(Although there are occasional team events, such as the Olympiad.)

Sentence nr: 91
“We respect and admire each other but mostly keep to ourselves because sooner or later we are going to have to play each other and then you might have mental conflict.” U.S. chess’s plan to shift players to its team has worked out beautifully on the surface.

Sentence nr: 92
Beneath it, though, its top player has wrestled with family strife and the growing pains of a new life under chess’s spotlight.

Sentence nr: 93
At the end of the 2015 national championship, So posted this message to his Facebook page: “Let me state right at the top of this that I write my own emails and NO ONE controls my communication, or when and how I choose to communicate.

Sentence nr: 94
I am not cut off, isolated, drugged, in bondage or kidnapped.

Sentence nr: 95
I do not belong to anyone but God.

Sentence nr: 96
I am a man who wishes to be let alone to find his own life.” He had been forced to forfeit a crucial game for writing notes to himself on a piece of paper, in violation of tournament rules.

Sentence nr: 97
The indiscretion came, So has explained, as the result of a bout of stress following an international family dispute.

Sentence nr: 98
At a dinner party in Minnesota in 2013, So met Lotis Key, a former film actress who has starred in over 75 Asian movies, and Renato “Bambi” Kabigting, a basketball star while in the Philippines.

Sentence nr: 99
The couple lives in Minnetonka, a leafy Minneapolis suburb.

Sentence nr: 100
The trio hit it off, and by the end of 2014, So had left college and moved in with them; he began calling Key mom.

Sentence nr: 101
According to an account Key gave the Star Tribune, the dispute at the tournament occurred when So’s birth mother, Eleanor So — who now lives in Canada — showed up at the tournament, demanding that he return to school and threatening to cut all ties to the family.

Sentence nr: 102
A minor scuffle — arm grabbing, yelling — ensued outside the chess club.

Sentence nr: 103
Eleanor So told the paper that, “Since someone is blocking us access to our own son, we had to try and see him in person to help him.” The meeting was orchestrated, Key told the Star Tribune, by Wesley So’s former coach at Webster University, Paul Truong, who was upset at having lost his star player when he dropped out.

Sentence nr: 104
Truong denied this and told me that So’s scholarship had been revoked, although he said he couldn’t discuss why.

Sentence nr: 105
“We knew that he was going to go through some rough times, and we just wanted to protect him, so we never bothered correcting what the media said,” Truong said.

Sentence nr: 106
Key told me that So decided to leave school, and turn pro, weeks before his scholarship was withdrawn.

Sentence nr: 107
“The simple fact is Wesley left because he was unhappy at Webster and had decided to play chess professionally,” she said in an email.

Sentence nr: 108
A spokesman for Webster declined to comment on why So left the university.

Sentence nr: 109
Several years before, Truong, in a separate incident, had been accused of posting obscene messages online under the name of a rival in a campaign to get elected to the U.S.

Sentence nr: 110
Chess Federation board.

Sentence nr: 111
(Truong continues to deny those accusations, although they were confirmed by a private investigator hired by U.S.

Sentence nr: 112
Chess.)

Sentence nr: 113
He was later ousted from the federation, and the legal dispute was settled.

Sentence nr: 114
Despite a strained relationship with So, Truong was optimistic about his future.

Sentence nr: 115
“Out of all the current players in the United States today, I believe that [So] would have the best chance to be the next world champion,” he said.

Sentence nr: 116
Hikaru Nakamura and Wesley So playing in the London Chess Classic in 2016.

Sentence nr: 117
Ray Tang / Anadolu Agency / Getty Images Amid this chess-world furor, So’s play has remained placid, and he described his adopted family as a supportive team.

Sentence nr: 118
“They have had a lot of foster kids over the years and because they are Christians they believe in helping others.” So, too, relies heavily on his Christian faith.

Sentence nr: 119
And it’s precisely his monkish calm and ascetic approach that fuel his game and intimidate his opponents.

Sentence nr: 120
“I do not go to parties.

Sentence nr: 121
I do not ‘hang out,’ I do not play games or use the internet,” So said in an email.

Sentence nr: 122
“I don’t drink alcohol, use drugs or eat junk food.

Sentence nr: 123
I don’t even have a cell phone.” Maurice Ashley, a grandmaster and chess commentator, described So as “playing the best chess” in the world right now, and others agree that So is on the brink of chess’s highest prize.

Sentence nr: 124
“It’s like he’s in the high Himalayas climbing, and it’s the last 1,000 feet toward the summit, toward the world championship,” Donaldson said.

Sentence nr: 125
“He’s in rarefied air.” As I sought to find out more about America’s best chess player, Key got wind of my inquiries.

Sentence nr: 126
“Why did you try to establish contact with his estranged relatives?” she asked about my having tried to reach his biological family.

Sentence nr: 127
“Aware that his enemies are always trying to hurt him, we wondered at the curious timing of your trying to locate them in the weeks just before the tournament began.” I never did reach So’s birth family, and my efforts to arrange more meaningful time with the grandmaster through his adoptive mother were unsuccessful.

Sentence nr: 128
Key insisted that all communication be funneled through her.

Sentence nr: 129
“You probably consider our precautions extraordinary,” she said.

Sentence nr: 130
“Yet consider that when you want to stop an elite skater you try to break her leg.

Sentence nr: 131
With a chess player, you must break something else.” The World Chess Championship operates like a fiefdom.

Sentence nr: 132
The reigning champion, currently the Norwegian Carlsen, is the overlord.

Sentence nr: 133
He sits in his throne waiting while the rest of the super-grandmasters bloody each other over the course of a grueling two-year cycle.

Sentence nr: 134
A triumphant performance in several Grand-Prix tournaments, the Chess World Cup or the official world rankings lands a contender in the Candidates Tournament, in which eight survivors battle each other one final time.

Sentence nr: 135
Exactly one of them wins the right to challenge the defending champion for the title in yet another lengthy series of games.

Sentence nr: 136
The next Candidates is slated for March 2018 and the next championship match for the following November.

Sentence nr: 137
Their locations have not yet been announced.

Sentence nr: 138
<pie> Who might challenge Carlsen?

Sentence nr: 139
Top players’ chance of winning Candidates Tournament (and challenging Carlsen), based on Elo ratings RANK PLAYER COUNTRY WIN PROB.

Sentence nr: 140
2 So 🇺🇸 25.2% 3 Caruana 🇺🇸 19.1 4 Kramnik 🇷🇺 14.5 5 Aronian 🇦🇲 12.5 6 Mamedyarov 🇦🇿 10.8 7 Nakamura 🇺🇸 8.4 8 Vachier-Lagrave 🇫🇷 6.2 12 Karjakin 🇷🇺 3.3 </pie> Includes the most highly rated players as of Aug. 1, and the defending world runner-up, Karjakin.

Sentence nr: 141
Based on data from 2700chess.com If the Candidates were held today and all three top Americans qualified, which they would if their official ratings are any guide, the Americans would have a better-than-50 percent chance of sending a challenger to face Carlsen, according to my simulations.

Sentence nr: 142
(Sergey Karjakin, last year’s challenger, qualifies for the Candidates automatically.)

Sentence nr: 143
Assuming any American that won the Candidates had a fighting chance against the Norwegian, we arrive at something like the following: There is a 1-in-5 chance that the next world chess champion will represent the United States.

Sentence nr: 144
Jennifer Shahade, a two-time U.S. women’s chess champion, had a similar outlook, although she hadn’t run any simulations.

Sentence nr: 145
“I’m also a poker player,” she told me, “and it’s definitely good odds.” She put the chances of an American challenging for the world title in the next two cycles at 55 percent.

Sentence nr: 146
Last year, Caruana missed a Candidates victory by one devastating game.

Sentence nr: 147
The world championship was then held in New York City, where Caruana spent some of his early years, and American observers saw it as a missed opportunity for the game in the States.

Sentence nr: 148
Few think the full-blown 1972 Fischer fever will take hold again in the U.S. — fueled, as it was, by Cold War implications — but everyone seems hopeful that another chance at glory will come.

Sentence nr: 149
“That will be the final sealing of the deal, to say U.S. chess is the best chess in the world, which is the goal,” Ashley told me as he was being miked up to broadcast the next round at the nationals.

Sentence nr: 150
“That’s how we roll.

Sentence nr: 151
That’s essential: to be the best.” Only So himself struck a melancholy note at the whole prospect.

Sentence nr: 152
“I sometimes feel sorry for [Carlsen] because the pressure is terrible,” he told me over email.

Sentence nr: 153
“If he even draws a game, people are disappointed.

Sentence nr: 154
People think they have a right to every bit of his life.

Sentence nr: 155
I don’t want to live like that.” But a world championship is the goal.

Sentence nr: 156
And it’s being pursued with that most American of fuels: money.

Sentence nr: 157
“A world championship would be spectacular,” said Walters, the U.S.

Sentence nr: 158
Chess president.

Sentence nr: 159
“And there are forces here in St. Louis who would put that very near the top of the list.” The three best American chess players: Hikaru Nakamura, Wesley So and Fabiano Caruana.

Sentence nr: 160
Getty Images On Oct. 10, 2016, at a rally in Ambridge, Pennsylvania, then-candidate Donald Trump was riffing on what he saw as the unfortunate complexity of existing U.S. trade deals.

Sentence nr: 161
To understand them, he said, “You have to be like a grand chess master — and we don’t have any of them.” At the time, the United States had 90 grandmasters.

Sentence nr: 162
Rex Sinquefield was listening to that speech, and he wasn’t pleased.

Sentence nr: 163
He reached for his cell phone, flipped through his contacts, and rang up Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence.

Sentence nr: 164
“I left a long message.

Sentence nr: 165
I said, ‘I want to explain to you, first of all, what’s going on in St. Louis.’ I said, ‘There are plenty of grandmasters.’ I said, ‘At any point in time, there are probably 25 grandmasters in St. Louis,’” Sinquefield recalled.

Sentence nr: 166
“Pence called me back … He said, ‘Rex, I had no idea what was going on in your city.’ He said, ‘This is absolutely amazing.’ He said, ‘I’m going to tell Donald.

Sentence nr: 167
He said, ‘He will be embarrassed and amused.’” (Sinquefield never heard from Trump.)

Sentence nr: 168
Sinquefield and I met in St. Louis in April in the midst of the national championship.

Sentence nr: 169
We sat on the second floor of the well-appointed chess club he founded in 2008.

Sentence nr: 170
On one side of the room stood chess tables prepared for battle.

Sentence nr: 171
On the other hung the spoils of the game — gleaming trophies and old photos of American legends, including Fischer.

Sentence nr: 172
Sinquefield wore a windbreaker over a polo shirt, both emblazoned with the insignia of his club, the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis.

Sentence nr: 173
Sinquefield — a multimillionaire or billionaire, depending on your source — is somewhere between a Medici and the Wizard of Oz of American chess.

Sentence nr: 174
He was raised in Saint Vincent Home for Children, an orphanage just outside the city, and went on to make his money pioneering index funds, after earning an MBA at the University of Chicago.

Sentence nr: 175
His current home, an 8,000-square-foot mansion on a private street a few blocks from the club, bears some resemblance to a rook.

Sentence nr: 176
He pours millions a year into this chess hamlet he’s built within the city’s tony Central West End.

Sentence nr: 177
Within a literal stone’s throw, there’s the three-story club, which has dues-paying members and hosts elite tournaments, a grandmaster-in-residence, and a high-tech production facility; a hall of fame and museum which houses an impressive collection of Fischer artifacts; a chess-themed diner which shows Cardinals baseball games and chess games on side-by-side TVs; and three “chess houses” which are home to a rotation of visiting players.

Sentence nr: 178
That’s all on one block, and doesn’t begin to mention the sidewalk chess tables and the 14½-foot-tall king that keeps watch over the street.

Sentence nr: 179
A 2015 New York Times article strongly suggested that Sinquefield footed the bill for Caruana’s transfer to the U.S. It’s a suggestion Sinquefield denies.

Sentence nr: 180
“He paid that fee entirely himself,” Sinquefield said.

Sentence nr: 181
“We didn’t pay a penny of it.” In either case, there’s no denying that the cash he has laid out has helped attract Caruana and So, and helped to launch a real bid for the world title.

Sentence nr: 182
Sinquefield predicts an American world champion by 2020.

Sentence nr: 183
If an American looks poised to qualify, he insisted he’d do everything he could to negotiate with FIDE to bring the match to St. Louis.

Sentence nr: 184
He even had a venue picked out.

Sentence nr: 185
What’s in it for Sinquefield?

Sentence nr: 186
Is this like some other billionaire owning a baseball team?

Sentence nr: 187
“This is infinitely more fun than that,” he said, adding that he’d turned down a chance to take an ownership share in the Cardinals.

Sentence nr: 188
Instead, Sinquefield says the answer is twofold: First, it’s a passion — a retirement hobby for a wealthy Missourian.

Sentence nr: 189
He learned the game when was 13 from his Uncle Fred.

Sentence nr: 190
When we spoke, he had 19 chess games in progress online, and he takes a weekly lesson from Shahade, the women’s national champion.

Sentence nr: 191
He’s on a first-name basis with most of the best players in the world, and he haunts the club during tournaments, keeping a close eye on the games.

Sentence nr: 192
Second, it’s an investment.

Sentence nr: 193
Sinquefield is a financier, a public policy wonk, and a fiscal conservative.

Sentence nr: 194
(Another lifelong passion is the elimination of income tax.)

Sentence nr: 195
He expects that his privately funded improvement in American chess will yield public returns.

Sentence nr: 196
These could come, he explained, in the form of educational and health outcomes.

Sentence nr: 197
His club is working to put chess in local schools and, in an effort to improve community relations, to train cops how to teach kids the game.

Sentence nr: 198
And he’s keeping a close eye on studies in a local hospital on the potentially ameliorative effects of chess on dementia and Alzheimer’s.

Sentence nr: 199
“It’s several million a year, easily,” Sinquefield said about what he’s putting into the game.

Sentence nr: 200
“So far it seems well worth it.” “It’s a dream — this is the Mecca of chess,” Shahade said.

Sentence nr: 201
“Obviously, the financial contributions are so considerable and so generous.

Sentence nr: 202
But a lot of the passion to donate that money is that Rex really absolutely loves chess and sees the multifaceted nature of the game.

Sentence nr: 203
And he really loves history.” Sinquefield is only a year younger than Fischer would be if he were alive.

Sentence nr: 204
The 1972 world championship, and the historic performance that led up to it, struck a nerve, and Sinquefield has been obsessed with Fischer and the game ever since.

Sentence nr: 205
He effortlessly rattled off Fischer’s conquests on his way to the world title.

Sentence nr: 206
“It had an impact on everybody,” Sinquefield said, speaking about the patriotic frenzy around the match.

Sentence nr: 207
“We were all captured by it.” And we may be again.

UPDATE (Aug. 8, 5:01 p.m.): This article has been updated with comments from Lotis Key on the timing of events surrounding So’s departure from Webster University.
