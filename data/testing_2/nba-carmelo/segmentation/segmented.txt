The Lakers� 33 Games To Greatness lakers Going into the 1971-72 season, the Los Angeles Lakers had a middling 1496 Elo rating, in part because their competition was watered down by the NBA's rapid expansion (the league had gone from nine to 17 franchises in the span of several years).

Sentence nr: 17

Sentence nr: 22
Still, the Celtics Elo rating hung around 1700 (really good) for much of the era, and the team maintained an above-average Elo rating for over 13 years.
