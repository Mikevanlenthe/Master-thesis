Sentence nr: 3
Inspired by this Wall Street Journal piece about the financial difficulties faced by The Weather Channel — Verizon FiOS dropped the station because of “customers’ growing use of online sources and apps to look up weather information” — I wondered how many people get their weather from the station.

Sentence nr: 4
Is it true that customers are flocking to apps and the Web?1 Because I’m 24, I either don’t bother checking the weather or just use the default app on my phone.

Sentence nr: 5
I assumed everyone else was like me in this regard.

Sentence nr: 6
I was wrong.

Sentence nr: 7
I couldn’t find data on this, so I asked SurveyMonkey Audience to run a simple survey.

Sentence nr: 8
It ran April 6-10 and had 938 respondents.

Sentence nr: 9
It asked two main questions: How do you check the weather?

Sentence nr: 10
And, do you check a weather report every day?

Sentence nr: 11
Here’s where people go for weather forecasts: METHOD PERCENTAGE Phone’s default weather app 23.2% Local TV news 20.6 A specific website or app 19.1 The Weather Channel 15.2 Internet search 14.2 Newspaper 3.5 Radio weather 3.4 Newsletter 0.9 The Weather Channel actually doesn’t do half bad here!

Sentence nr: 12
It had 15.2 percent penetration overall, and that was pretty consistent regardless of how old the respondent was.

Sentence nr: 13
About 4 in 5 respondents said they check a weather report daily.

Sentence nr: 14
And there were a couple of interesting differences in how people looked up the weather, depending on whether they were a daily checker or not.

Sentence nr: 15
People who said they checked the weather every day were more likely to go to a specific website or app (21 percent of daily checkers versus 10 percent of non-daily checkers) or The Weather Channel (16 percent of dailies versus 10 percent of non-dailies).

Sentence nr: 16
Non-dailies were much more likely to just do an Internet search (23 percent versus 12 percent for daily checkers).

Sentence nr: 17
And while The Weather Channel performed relatively equally across age groups, weather-checking in general isn’t a young person’s game.

Sentence nr: 18
The probability that a respondent checked the weather on a daily basis climbed with his or her age bracket: 68 percent of people 18 to 29 years old checked the weather daily, while 87 percent of people 60 and older did.

Sentence nr: 19
(Not super shocking either: The older a respondent was, the more likely he or she was to get weather from radio, local TV and newspapers.

Sentence nr: 20
)2 Among respondents from New England, home to a lot of harsh weather, 94 percent checked the weather every day.

Sentence nr: 21
On the other end of the spectrum, 70 percent of respondents in the Pacific region — those smug jerks in California, Oregon and Washington who were Snapchatting east-coasters like me all winter with their stupid temperate and predictable climate — felt the need to check a daily report.

Sentence nr: 22
But the really interesting finding from this isn’t about newspapers or even The Weather Channel.

Sentence nr: 23
It’s about local television news.

Sentence nr: 24
So 36 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds got their weather from their phone’s default weather app, compared with 14 percent of people aged 60 and older.

Sentence nr: 25
That’s a 22 percentage point difference.

Sentence nr: 26
Where were those 22 points being taken away from?

Sentence nr: 27
It’s not The Weather Channel: Slightly more young people got their news from the network than the 60-and-over crowd.

Sentence nr: 28
No, the weather app on your phone is sucking eyeballs away from local television news.

Sentence nr: 29
For people 60 and up, 29 percent got their weather from local news.

Sentence nr: 30
Only 8 percent of the 18- to 29-year-old crowd did.

Sentence nr: 31
That’s a 21 percentage point difference.

Sentence nr: 32
Sure, The Weather Channel has some financial difficulties ahead when it comes to getting carriage fees where they’d liked them.

Sentence nr: 33
But the network’s problems don’t really seem to be generational, at least not according to this data.

Sentence nr: 34
Local news weather’s may very well be.

Sentence nr: 35
All the data from this survey is up at GitHub.

Sentence nr: 36
One thing I didn’t look at that might be interesting is the “a specific website or app” category, where we asked respondents to volunteer which particular website or app they use.

Sentence nr: 37
Dig into the data, and let me know if you find anything.
