PUBLISHED 4:00 PM EDT | JUL 14, 2016 Hip-Hop Is Turning On Donald Trump Rappers love Trump�s money, but now they hate his politics.

Sentence nr: 1
By Allison McCann A small black child holds a �Fuck Donald Trump!� poster as sirens ring out and a police helicopter patrols overhead.

Sentence nr: 2
The rapper YG appears, both middle fingers raised, and emphatically raps�Fuck Donald Trump / Fuck Donald Trump�over and over again.

Sentence nr: 3
The imagery in the video for this year�s �FDT (Fuck Donald Trump)� by YG and Nipsey Hussle was striking, and the explicitly anti-Trump lyrics in a hip-hop song were even more so.

Sentence nr: 4
After decades of rap songs extolling Trump�s name � praising his wealth, his TV show and his luxury hotel chain � �FDT� felt like the first of its kind.

Sentence nr: 5
Except that it wasn�t.

Sentence nr: 6
In a 1993 song, The Coup, a group from Oakland, California, rapped, �Break yourself Trump, it's collection day / Break yourself DuPont, it's collection day / You stole the shit from my great granddaddy anyway.�Although not as explicit as YG�s lyric, The Coup�s message for Trump was clearly negative � they and their fellow revolutionaries were coming for Trump�s money, and it was rightfully theirs.

Sentence nr: 7
Hip-hop has long been a political genre; artists often draw from and critique those in power.

Sentence nr: 8
�Hip-hop has earned a creative license to offer a critical narrative of celebrity and political figures, and unlike other genres of popular music, hip-hop has always made it a priority,� said S. Craig Watkins, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin and the author of �Hip Hop Matters: Politics, Pop Culture, and the Struggle for the Soul of a Movement.� Now that Trump's public persona has shifted from business mogul to politician, and includes controversial statements on race, immigration and Muslims, I wondered whether the hip-hop discourse surrounding him was changing too.

Sentence nr: 9
So I asked the lyrics annotation site Genius to send me every reference to Trump that appears in its database of songs.

Sentence nr: 10
To put his cultural position in context, I also requested the data on all the 2016 candidates � Democratic and Republican � who made it to the Iowa caucuses.1The data set was rife with Trump, whose prominence and longevity as a figure in hip-hop is staggering: He and his brand have been referenced in 266 songs dating back to 1989; in one year alone (2013), there were 33 references.2 But perhaps even more surprising is that Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family3have their own long, voluminous history of hip-hop references.

Sentence nr: 11
They�ve been mentioned in 92 songs since 1993.

Sentence nr: 12
And the other candidates?

Sentence nr: 13
Seventeen songs, combined.

Sentence nr: 14
Every mention of 2016 primary candidates in hip-hop songs TRUMP CLINTON BUSH CHRISTIE HUCKABEE SANDERS CARSON CRUZ 1990 '95 2000 '05 '10 '15 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 It is unheard of for two presidential nominees to have been part of hip-hop�s conversation for so long � artists have dutifully chronicled their lives for decades.�Hillary's still with Bill Clinton, how do they do it?

Sentence nr: 15
/ He got his dick sucked and the whole damn world knew it,�Ludacris rapped on �Let�s Stay Together.� Trump�s personal life hasn�t gone unnoticed, either.�They high drama like Trump and Ivana,�Souls of Mischief rhymed on �Soundscience.� To see whether the narratives around Trump and Clinton were changing in the run-up to the 2016 election, I and a group of FiveThirtyEight staffers classified every reference as positive, negative or neutral.

Sentence nr: 16
(At least as well as we could!

Sentence nr: 17
)4Lyrics that praised the person or were aspirational (for example, �I�m rich just like Donald Trump�) received a classification of �positive.� �Negative� classifications went to those that were explicitly derogatory (for example, �Never put your trust in Hillary Rodham�) or misogynistic/sexist.

Sentence nr: 18
Everything else we left as �neutral,� including references that didn�t express an opinion (for example, �Donald Trump said buy an apartment wit her�), that involved sex acts which could be interpreted differently based on who was assuming sexual agency, and whose meaning we could not decipher.

Sentence nr: 19
Because Clinton has been a politicized figure since the 1990s and is a woman, she unsurprisingly has fared much worse than Trump in hip-hop.

Sentence nr: 20
About a third of all references to her were negative (17 percent were positive), and many of those occurred during her first run for the Democratic nomination.

Sentence nr: 21
�You more like Hillary / Only in it cuz you used to fuck the ex leader,�Charles Hamilton said on �Unapologetic� in 2008.

Sentence nr: 22
<bar>Trump, on the other hand, coasted from 1989 to 2014, with fewer negative references during that span than Clinton had in her worst single year.

Sentence nr: 23
Overall, only 13 percent of all Trump references were negative, while 60 percent have been positive.</bar> Candidate mentions, by sentiment POSITIVE 1990 '95 2000 '05 '10 '15 0 5 10 15 20 NEGATIVE 1990 '95 2000 '05 '10 '15 0 5 10 15 20 NEUTRAL 1990 '95 2000 '05 '10 '15 0 5 10 15 20 TRUMP CLINTON BUSH CHRISTIE HUCKABEE SANDERS CARSON CRUZ Things started to look a little different for Trump in 2015.

Sentence nr: 24
Before that year, Trump had received only eight negative references in total; over the last year and a half, however, that number has quadrupled, to 34.

Sentence nr: 25
(He still received 17 neutral and 16 positive references during that time.)

Sentence nr: 26
Rick Ross has referenced Trump more than any other artist in our data set.

Sentence nr: 27
Before 2015, he mentioned Trump seven times, none of which were negative.

Sentence nr: 28
But something changed for Ross in 2015.

Sentence nr: 29
In September, on his �Black Dollar� mixtape, Ross boasted,�Bel Air bottles like a boss, penthouse at the Trump.�But just three months later, on �Free Enterprise,� he rapped, �Assassinate Trump like I'm Zimmerman.� Of the 262 artists in our data set, only Ross and Nas have referenced Trump more than the Atlanta trio Migos � and none of the group�s six mentions were negative.

Sentence nr: 30
In their 2016 song �Bars,� Migos rapped: �Billionaire looking my way I�m on pace / Feeling like Donald Trump back in the day.� When I asked Migos about what Trump represented in their music, they said he was a useful shorthand.

Sentence nr: 31
�We was talking about being rich and being worthy, that we feel like we the Donald Trumps of the hood, of the trap, of the street,� said Quavo of Migos.

Sentence nr: 32
But Offset, his groupmate, said the group�s, and hip-hop�s, attitude toward Trump is changing.

Sentence nr: 33
�Now, instead of people saying they got money like him, it�s fuck him, because of him showing who he is as a person,� he said.

Sentence nr: 34
Quavo said that in an upcoming song, he will reference Trump politically for the first time � that is to say, negatively.

Sentence nr: 35
This shift in sentiment against Trump is marked by a clear increase in references to his politics, but his political references still haven�t surpassed the number of references to his wealth (102) or to the Trump Tower (68).5 As for Clinton, many of her references have been political (21), but a few, like one in Big Sean�s �Whatever You Want,� nod to her wealth, too: �Leading lady like Hillary grabbing big Bills.� Candidate mentions, by subject WEALTH 1990 '95 2000 '05 '10 '15 0 5 10 15 TRUMP TOWER 1990 '95 2000 '05 '10 '15 0 5 10 15 POLITICS 1990 '95 2000 '05 '10 '15 0 5 10 15 TRUMP CLINTON BUSH SANDERS CRUZ As hip-hop artists grapple with Trump�s new political persona, there will almost certainly be an increase in the number of references to his politics � but will that also mean fewer references to his wealth?

Sentence nr: 36
There are aspects of Trump that will always be hip-hop: how boastful he is, how brazen he is about his money.

Sentence nr: 37
And some artists are already trying to reconcile these two Trump narratives: �Listen I ain't from the slums, I fought my way up out the slum / Arrogant rich n----, we might vote for Trump,� Cam�ron rapped on �Dope Spot� last year.

Sentence nr: 38
Should Clinton win the election, the misogyny that typically dominates hip-hop will have to reckon with a female president.

Sentence nr: 39
Lil B The BasedGod, for one, is ready: �Shouts-out to Hillary Clinton / You �bout to win that president shit.�6 Statistically speaking, hip-hop lyrics have no bearing on who will win this year�s election.

Sentence nr: 40
But hip-hop will continue to provoke and challenge our opinions of those in power.

Sentence nr: 41
Trump�s shifting hip-hop narrative makes this clear: No pop art more swiftly reflects the sentiments of progressive culture than rap music.

Sentence nr: 42
�Hip-hop expands in ways no one can anticipate,� Watkins said.

Sentence nr: 43
Regardless of who wins in November, hip-hop is sure to respond.
