Sentence nr: 2
Every week, I offer up problems related to the things we hold dear around here: math, logic and probability.

Sentence nr: 3
There are two types: Riddler Express for those of you who want something bite-sized and Riddler Classic for those of you in the slow-puzzle movement.

Sentence nr: 4
Submit an answer for either,1 and you may get a shoutout in next week’s column.

Sentence nr: 5
If you need a hint, you can try asking me nicely on Twitter.

Sentence nr: 6
Riddler Express A classic participatory game-theory problem: Submit a whole number between 1 and 1,000,000,000.

Sentence nr: 7
I’ll then take all those numbers and find the average submission.

Sentence nr: 8
Whoever submits the number closest to ⅔ of the mean of all of the submitted numbers wins.

Sentence nr: 9
Submit your number Riddler Classic Suggested by Joel Baker, a very special Riddler Nation battle royale!

Sentence nr: 10
In a distant, war-torn land, there are 10 castles.

Sentence nr: 11
There are two warlords: you and your archenemy.

Sentence nr: 12
Each castle has its own strategic value for a would-be conqueror.

Sentence nr: 13
Specifically, the castles are worth 1, 2, 3, …, 9, and 10 victory points.

Sentence nr: 14
You and your enemy each have 100 soldiers to distribute, any way you like, to fight at any of the 10 castles.

Sentence nr: 15
Whoever sends more soldiers to a given castle conquers that castle and wins its victory points.

Sentence nr: 16
If you each send the same number of troops, you split the points.

Sentence nr: 17
You don’t know what distribution of forces your enemy has chosen until the battles begin.

Sentence nr: 18
Whoever wins the most points wins the war.

Sentence nr: 19
Submit a plan distributing your 100 soldiers among the 10 castles.

Sentence nr: 20
Once I receive all your battle plans, I’ll adjudicate all the possible one-on-one matchups.

Sentence nr: 21
Whoever wins the most wars wins the battle royale and is crowned king or queen of Riddler Nation!

Submit your plan Solution to last week’s Riddler Express Congratulations to 👏 Stephen Carrier 👏 of Berkeley, California, winner of last week’s Express puzzle!

Sentence nr: 23
In the game Tetris, if you’re lucky, you can clear the board after the first five pieces are placed.

Sentence nr: 24
Knowing that, how many arrangements of Tetris pieces are there that form a solid block that’s two squares high by 10 squares wide?

Sentence nr: 25
There are 64.

Sentence nr: 26
Here is an illustration of all the arrangements, from Vivek M.: A number of intrepid solvers also noticed a lovely pattern.

Sentence nr: 27
The number of ways to fill a two-by-two, two-by-four, two-by-six, two-by-eight, and so forth, empty space with Tetris pieces is equal to the Fibonacci numbers squared: 1, 4, 9, 25, 64, 169, and so on.

Sentence nr: 28
For a fantastic discussion of this pattern and Tetris math, check out this document from solver and “former Tetris addict” Samuel Wirajaya.

Sentence nr: 29
Math is cool.

Solution to last week’s Riddler Classic Congratulations to 👏 Alex Szatmary 👏 of Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, winner of last week’s Classic puzzle!

Sentence nr: 31
At the beginning of time, there is a single microorganism.

Sentence nr: 32
Every day, a member of its species either splits into two copies of itself or dies.

Sentence nr: 33
If the probability of multiplication is p, what are the chances that this species goes extinct?

Sentence nr: 34
If p ≤ ½, the species will go extinct for sure.

Sentence nr: 35
If p > ½, it’s got a fighting chance.

Sentence nr: 36
Specifically, it will go extinct with probability (1/p)-1.\(\) Why?

Sentence nr: 37
Call the probability that the species goes extinct q. That’s the probability that the original microorganism dies (1-p) plus the conditional probability that, if it multiplies, both of its “children” go extinct.

Sentence nr: 38
Therefore, \begin{equation}q = (1 – p) + p q^2\end{equation} Solving that for q, we get two solutions: q = (1/p) – 1 and q = 1.

Sentence nr: 39
The former is a well-defined probability (that is, it’s between 0 and 1) only as long as p > ½.

Sentence nr: 40
If p ≤ ½, we know the probability of extinction is 1.

Sentence nr: 41
Here’s a chart, from Laurent Lessard, of the probability of extinction given the different probabilities of a single microorganism successfully multiplying: Good luck out there, little guy.
