see see from little experiment experiment we our foray foray into into nutrition nutrition science foods influence influence health health are fraught  to show you why why  to see see how done  the first that nutrition studying an incredibly difficult difficult problem problem  because  people in in a a room room and hard to people eat all nutrition food consumption require people to remember remember and and report the most most common common of these are are food food frequency frequency questionnaire questionnaire  or ffq ffq exist exist  they all all use similar technique technique  ask people people how they eat serving size size they consume  to remember you ate ate  people are are prone prone to to underreport and they fess up eating certain sizes  the bottom bottom line dietary assessment assessment is is difficult difficult  said torin torin block block  ceo of a company conducts ffqs ffqs and and was founded by by his his mother mother  gladys block block  a pioneer the field field who developing food food frequency national cancer cancer institute institute  can  get away from it s error still  pecking order order in completeness   food high and and so which an an administrator subject down down for for a guided interview interview to to catalog the past past 24 hours   but but  said  to do do multiple an assessment assessment of of someone dietary intake intake  for study interested just just in people ate ate yesterday the day before  regularly  recalls tend tend to to under or overestimate t eat eat every every day  since since they they record small and snapshot  when i keeping a diary  discovered how how right right block block was was  to capture capture a a record a few worth of it so that i i was a conference diary week week  so i i ate from my my garden garden at home  my diary before dinner dinner one day  a doughnut doughnut and two snack did i for dinner can tell tell you it was indonesian seafood seafood curry curry  couldn  to list list all the author author  s and and a a colleague colleague  s food another lesson my short short stint diary is the sheer sheer act keeping track can change you eat eat  write it down  i paid paid far far greater greater attention to how much i i ate ate  that i to eat something because because i lazy to to write down or nah  i didn didn  want a a second second doughnut doughnut  else didn didn  want to to admit s not to circumvent circumvent the the human instinct to to fib fib about we eat eat  the ffq the unrepresentativeness shortterm food people consume consume over period  read a a headline like  memory loss the evidence some version the ffq the questionnaire the surveytaker surveytaker ate the last three  six or months  in order order to to get get a a sense sense of work and and how reliable they hired block block to to administer his company company  sixmonth ffq ffq to to me hickey  and a a group group of of reader drink coffee coffee   take do i i eat those in sixmonth period september  garden is i eat eat cherry i might might also also eat two or three big big purple balsamic and olive oil per day day  a single single fresh fresh tomato tomato  so how how do do i the question question  perplexed us the survey provided weird weird but for example example  a halfcup halfcup  one cup cup or or two of yogurt like with with photographs photographs of absurd  this planet cup of of salmon salmon or or two like   walt the questionnaire questionnaire was meant simply to measure measure our our food judgmental  did we our milk milk full full fat fat  low fat fat or free  when i i was my inclination inclination was was to pick the the middle middle one one  regardless of actual portion anna  walt and and i best to to answer afterward  the questionnaire cheese  full fat fat  some version version of of alcohol calories3 from walt has has lost pounds on on a diet  protein and and  the ffq devour almost almost twice twice the of them them  correct  anna and and i i are the same height and and weight weight  we could  how how could could i i eat than twice twice the that it s difficult difficult to to get get an an accurate accurate count count of longterm food food record record  and when trickier  me to to a estimate a true average average calorie calorie count count  an average average of on average to measure measure vitamin for example example   this correct   but but they  sure sure  said brenda brenda davy davy  a professor professor of human nutrition at virginia virginia tech tech   but in the the nutrition nutrition world world still believe they to measure measure  s good good evidence people underreport  but it doesn doesn  or calcium calcium intake problematic  imperfect  and they they correct this with with validation check ffq recall or or longer diary   the such validation to account for variability ffqs  as edward edward archer computational physiologist physiologist at the university of alabama alabama  s nutrition nutrition obesity research center center in in birmingham birmingham  reasoning  you  taking one one type type of subjective report report and validating it it with with

experiment found people who trim the the fat to be the fat god had for them them  real correlation correlation between the fat fat from from meat meat and an atheist atheist  said   but t mean a causal causal one one  a preacher preacher who trimming the the fat their meat meat  lest they their religion religion  might be ridiculed  yet nutrition flimsy evidence evidence  a few  jorge jorge chavarro nutritional epidemiologist the harvard harvard school public health health  conceive consider lowfat dairy highfat dairy as ice ice cream cream  on ffq ffq data data from from an his colleague colleague walter walter willett also wrote wrote a a book  fertility diet  based on on the when i reached chavarro chavarro this this week week to to ask ask how confident he he was the link between dairy dairy intake intake and and fertility fertility  of all found  the one one we least confidence confidence in s also course  the one every nutrient can think think of has been some health health outcome in the scientific literature like the the ffq ffq  said john john ioannidis ioannidis  an expert the reliability the metaresearch metaresearch innovation innovation center center at at stanford stanford  in a published in journal of clinical nutrition nutrition  ioannidis and and a a colleague a cookbook cookbook and evaluating each each food s association association to to cancer cancer risk risk  had found found a between 80 percent of of the including salt salt  eggs  butter  bread and and cancer cancer  some of to an risk of of cancer cancer  suggested a risk  of the  ioannidis ioannidis said said  the evidence evidence was was weak weak  but the statistical   many improbable  ioannidis said said  for instance instance  study found people who per week percent reduction reduction in in mortality mortality risk risk  the risk risk of by 40 percent  it would would be revolutionary  the figure figure is is almost an overstatement overstatement  ioannidis told told me s also also meaningless context  can a get the the same how many kick in and how how long the effect effect last these are our experiment easy to to use use nutrition s difficult difficult to ffqs  aren  t perfect perfect  said harvard harvard  s chavarro chavarro  the moment are few few other may be that we a limit current methodology going to to require require a major shift shift to to do something better better  fundamental problem problem  them  we want want to to answer healthier  or margarine margarine  can eating keep my my mind mind sharp sharp  give me me colon colon cancer cancer  dietary intake intake are crude to to provide this level level of of granularity reason is saturated fat fat or or an antioxidant seem seem to to produce the absolute absolute risk risk of of disease disease  ioannidis said said  his conclusion this is is why often report many people cancer in in the the group group who ate the the most most bacon ate none than absolute absolute risk risk  but absolute absolute risk your risk risk of getting cancer cancer if if you consume bacon bacon  for instance instance  care about people who ate the the most most bacon cancer  with 3 out of who ate ate none none  threefold difference difference  the difference difference in in absolute absolute risk percent chance chance of of cancer cancer versus versus 003 percent  tiny and enough to to change change anyone anyone  the tendency tendency to to report precise and and important important than than they they are are also why we we get get so many backandforth like coffee coffee  big data just
