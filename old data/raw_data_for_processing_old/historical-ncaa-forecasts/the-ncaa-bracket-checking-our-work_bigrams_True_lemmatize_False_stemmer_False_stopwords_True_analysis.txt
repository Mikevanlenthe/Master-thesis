clearer edge edge  duke was was a percent favorite favorite against against mercer mercer last week  but mercer these are happen some some of of the the time time  the question question in probabilistic forecast forecast is or less expected  technical term term for for this this is is calibration calibration  but you you might might think think of of it it more more as as truth over the long run run  of all all the a team team is is a favorite  is it percent of of the the time time  fivethirtyeight  s ncaa published each year since the formula changed very very little little over

evaluation total of games  counting the the 52 played so so far far this year  playin  can find find a containing our our past important to the new new york fivethirtyeight in in advance of each each game game  these are overall  percent of of the the time time  how often the favorite to win win  our model model  percent of of the the time time  so at at a macro level level   the calibrated  percent is is well the 95 percent confidence confidence interval interval drawn drawn by simulating the times   but doesn  t tell everything  s also that the the heavier like duke duke in against mercer mercer  the slim michigan state state against against virginia virginia  to evaluate evaluate this this  can break break the the 254 games down down into the most intuitive way way is is to first digit digit of favorite  s win win probability probability  for example example  one bin the 40 games in in which favorite  s win win probability probability was somewhere in in the that is percent to to 9999999 percent  in practice heaviest favorite favorite in our database database is is ohio ohio state state  percent chance chance of the university of texas texas at san antonio antonio in in 2011 d expect expect the the favorite favorite to to win percent of the favorite percent of of the the time time  year and and missouri missouri in in 2012 which lost lost to to norfolk state despite being a favorite  another bin the 50s from 500 percent to to 599 percent  to win percent of of the the time time  in fact fact  won 38 of 63 games  or 603 percent of of the the time time  so the the teams better than contrast  percent to to 699 percent  their 60 games  or 583 percent  a bit bit worse worse than going on  how how are with win performing worse worse than the 50s  are
