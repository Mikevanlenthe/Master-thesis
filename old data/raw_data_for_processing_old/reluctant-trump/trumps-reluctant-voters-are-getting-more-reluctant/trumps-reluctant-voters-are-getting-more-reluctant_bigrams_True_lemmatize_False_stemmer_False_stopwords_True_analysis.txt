very very few worried  harry  political writer writer  biggest fan fan of of the the  right direction direction  wrong direction direction   question don  but it just 30 percent of of the the overall overall sample the country country was going in in the right direction direction  reluctant trump trump sample closer to to the the average average voter voter  the average enthusiastic trump trump voter voter   editor editor in in chief chief  agree with with clare clare  expect people people who for trump last resort resort to to be happy about about the the state the country country  but i i also agree with with harry m not quite sure sure how how the the  right direction direction  behavior  agree  all üòÄ micah  boring  harry  love ‚Ä¶ micah  next ‚Ä¶ do you approve or disapprove of the way way president president trump trump is his job job  among trump to vote vote trump trump not to vote vote trump disapprove 4 a 3227 source   surveymonkey surveymonkey harry harry   more about the the same same as as they time we june  but the the percentage percentage of reluctant trump the president president  s job job is down 11 from 74 percent before before  substantial slide slide  talking point can do do to the people people who for him him  in fact a bit bit worse worse than than they the surface surface  among reluctant approve of of trump trump  higher percentage percent  disapprove of his performance performance  harry  percent who approve is down from from 15 percent in in june june  claremalone  and we we should this survey survey was the aftermath aftermath of charlottesville  trump  s arizona arizona speech speech  micah  can trump trump win win reelection reluctant group group this this lukewarm lukewarm on on him him  mean ‚Ä¶ him  to vote for trump trump  the 2020 democratic candidate candidate is is will demonized by by trump trump  kick in trump won won  in part part  because a a lot of people people who both clinton clinton and and trump a chance chance on on him him  dynamic is to prevail prevail next next time time around around  harry  hold on conservative are are they a majority majority  percent  say they they are conservative   but that  s far far less other  enthused trump percent   claremalone claremalone  s difficult to imagine imagine a democratic candidate candidate who would lure lure them them away it is yeah ‚Ä¶ but let let  come back back to that question question in in one one minute minute ‚Ä¶ it is president trump trump will for reelection reelection in in 2020 among trump to vote vote trump trump not to vote vote trump trump very all 2 answer 1 source  surveymonkey claremalone claremalone  is the the point point of that question question  i ask why do do we we ask why not skip straight straight to to the the  na vote him  uptick in might call among both about trump to resign resign  like it s sort sort of coping mechanism for people people who has to to be be some some sort end point point or some sort of consequence consequence for for trump trump  behavior  micah  ‚Ä¶ if if the the 2020 today  you ‚Ä¶ among trump to vote vote trump trump not to vote vote trump vote to reelect trump trump 63 ‚Äì 12 vote to reelect trump trump 28 ‚Äì 36 probably vote for someone else 5 for someone else 3 vote 1 answer 0 source  surveymonkey claremalone claremalone  percent are toward not for him him and and not voting  so ‚Ä¶ m not a huge huge fan fan of matching someone someone up hypothetical or d rather rather just just look their approval rating  harry  why  mr silver silver  a voter can imagine imagine the the   someone else  of his his or a john john kasich some  a marco marco rubio rubio for mike pence pence for for a a few few  michael bloomberg or i i guess guess if this question question is general election to return return to to clare s question of democrat could lure a moderate moderate democrat democrat  joe manchin manchin  might not not vote kamala harris harris or or someone someone  though   claremalone claremalone  s fan fan fic sense  harry  particular case case  the vote vote to reelect percentage percentage is is smaller the approval approval  for both reluctant trump excited trump micah  mean  harry  harry  of trump trump  voters approve approve of of trump trump than to vote for him him again backs up s point maybe they they  their dream dream candidate candidate  micah   one question and and then then we ll talk talk a a bit bannon ‚Ä¶ if president president trump from office office  mike pence pence be be ‚Ä¶ among trump to vote vote trump trump not to vote vote trump trump a a better better president president than than trump worse president president than than trump no different different than president trump trump 57 ‚Äì 17 ‚Äì no answer 4 source   surveymonkey surveymonkey micah mean  reluctant trump want in that question question  right  the other thing to to me excited trump think pence pence would would be be better better than than worse worse  a separate separate question on pence pence  reluctant trump percent  that great great  by comparison comparison   pence pence  favorable rating rating was nonreluctant trump but the reluctant trump republican to to trump trump  micah  is pence pence a republican  generic as as hell hell  tbh   claremalone claremalone  micah  m so so glad glad you i wrote potential mike mike pence pence presidency presidency  s pretty conservative  he was was a a tea tea partier long before before we the term term  tea party party  to do do the generic republican republican would want to to do do in in office office  he would would be be a conventional leader leader than than trump trump  be the for him him from  pence pence is s sort sort of a bit bit player player right not sure role he but he he isn isn  making a a lot lot of will change change if president pence pence  presidential candidate candidate pence pence  thing  one of the north north and midwest is he wasn wasn  conservative  i do do wonder what percentage percentage of of people people who like pence pence now wouldn  t after after it it became clear how conservative he he is the bigger bigger question question is is still would go go for for a a democrat democrat over trump  micah  or for kasich  s independent independent bid bid andor primary challenge challenge  that  i want want to to repeat statistic one one more more time both trump trump and and clinton clinton went for trump trump 4730 according to to the the exit exit poll poll  was worth a net net of for trump trump  popular vote vote by points  rather than points  electoral college college by by a a decent decent margin margin  claremalone  i kinda is ripe ripe for for  rossperotredux  harry  can get get perot perot to

administration administration ‚Ä¶ among trump to vote vote trump trump not to vote vote trump trump better better off worse off off 7 different 53 ‚Äì 59 ‚Äì no answer 3 source   surveymonkey harry  mean the the lack lack of between the interesting   claremalone claremalone  american people people didn didn  t buy narrative of of bannon bannon as as shadow shadow president president so so they think trump trump is the one the administration administration  for better better or for worse worse  guess steve steve bannon bannon the the man man doesn doesn  a base base ‚Ä¶ not sure sure we did  so loyal the president everything he best light light  outweigh the the fact moderate and and less bannonish   claremalone claremalone  breitbart  powerful  own base base of sorts  natesilver  percent

sure some of of them them are the people people who don  t like like trump trump because because he he wasn wasn  t moderate enough   while want someone someone  to make make trump trump change change his behavior  micah  to close close us here  s your your main main takeaway this data data  trump stand stand with with the the  reluctant trump trump  group  harry  doing worse worse than than he he was approval question question  big effect trump  disorderly conduct conduct in in the the white white house house  making people who didn didn  to vote him in in the first place place  should be be
