prisoner war and and many his immediate immediate demise5 demise5 but but trump trump  rising instead instead  a reputation reputation for being a  teflon teflon candidate candidate  seen a a lot commentary to to the the effect the press press was slow to the appeal of trump trump to was a a lot of variation with fivethirtyeight being on on the the slower come around around  but overall overall  that hypothesis hypothesis doesn doesn  hold up up well well once once you the evidence august  about how trump  power  was  political doom doom  and how how his his topline were evidence

was the media much time citing trump trump  which  after all all  him with with a lead   spent spent a a lot lot of of time this in in the the summer part of of the the issue issue is been very such as as rudy rudy giuliani howard dean dean  herman cain cain  rick perry perry and hillary clinton clinton  in 2008 can attest attest  if trump and clinton clinton wind wind up early poll poll success

trump nomination more than typical for for a polling frontrunner frontrunner  part of why trump trump  s path path to general election whom trump trump has trump  s weakness general election been evident evident for for a time  s not new story story  though it it has has just to get get more more coverage coverage  the media media may slow to recognize trump trump  s popularity it took took a month or or two two after after he his campaign campaign  but it it was slower to his unpopularity and trump trump is is a unpopular candidate candidate with with the the broader public  the autumn autumn of of trump trump  a break break in in trump trump coverage coverage  then came came paris a few few other our story story  however  for instance instance  you might might assume that trump trump has news coverage coverage from from wire wire to to wire wire   but was a period in focused on on trump trump  in the the 53day period from through nov  trump trump was lead story story on the media instead  important noncampaign this period shutdown in in late late september republican house house speakership speakership transition october  frequent topic topic was democratic race race  though clinton clinton  quite a a bit bit better better than than trump trump  larger share democratic vote than trump republican vote vote  a larger her nearest than trump his  and better better  fairly poor general election the media portrayed clinton clinton  negative light light  there was was also continuing coverage the scandal her private private email email server frequent speculation speculation about about joe joe biden democratic race race  by midoctober midoctober  after a for clinton and after after biden he wouldn wouldn  t run democratic race receded from from the  but been an interesting symbiosis between coverage coverage of of clinton clinton and and coverage coverage of of trump clinton  to run run a a lowkey prevent defense defense  type of of campaign campaign  from trump so many while bernie been hurt hurt by by it late october november  there was was also of coverage republican race wasn  trumpcentric  a lot this coverage ben carson carson  four straight tough coverage coverage from from nov but the the more receive all much attention attention  from trump trump  s entry the race race in in june the end end of  rubio rubio was lead story story on jeb bush bush also and john john kasich kasich zero scott walker focal point point just just twice the day day he the race and the the day day after after he he quit the nontrump gaining traction traction  it became became harder harder after the terrorist paris on on nov san bernardino bernardino  california  on dec after a a few when coverage coverage of of the trump made his response on dec dec 7 when he a ban ban on muslim immigration immigration  this period coincided with with a renewed rise rise for for trump quite stagnant stagnant throughout throughout the the fall fall  likewise  coincided with with a big increase increase in in the the amount media coverage coverage of of trump trump  dec 7 through sunday  trump trump was lead story story on on memeorandum memeorandum on days  or just than half half the the time time  from about about 30 percent of of the the time time beforehand beforehand  the correlation correlation is strong  the causal between trump trump  those in in his his media media coverage coverage are hard to to sort sort out in part part because because they reinforce one but it s at at least paris and and san san bernardino the cycle cycle of of attention to trump trump when when it out otherwise otherwise  the winter winter of of trump trump  manic coverage coverage and republicans since since dec dec 22 trump has than half half the the time time  including one one streak this month did so days in in a a row row  there  been a a lot republican   party stop trump trump   since since feb feb 1 iowa  new hampshire hampshire and and other which has gone well for trump trump  individual story story about about trump trump has news coverage coverage for for more more than for a a more breakdown of when trump chicago after led memeorandum memeorandum for the fact that trump trump has condoned violence violence against led a a day of coverage coverage  christie  s endorsement endorsement of of trump half a a day remember when when trump into a a fight fight with with pope pope francis francis  that story story also led coverage coverage for half a a day missed   you push back back against the current current lead lead story the trump trump campaign campaign  abusive treatment treatment of of reporter reporter michelle interesting to to the the press press than the broader broader public public  for instance instance   but the media media has a lot lot of value  to defend breaking from from rubio rubio  s postdebate postdebate buzz buzz to cover the the christie christie endorsement endorsement  for example  the the problem problem is cumulative effect effect of the trump trump story scant coverage coverage of than trump trump and and clinton clinton  including the the other have not received all much opportunity build momentum the campaign campaign trail trail  have they gotten all vetting or been subject subject to to all be part part of of why rubio  s standing much during february and and march march  for example example  t heard heard much him  february  to memeorandum memeorandum  so a minor story story  such as as a strong or or weak weak debate debate  could weigh their opinion him  problem is trump is is very dictating the his coverage coverage  both by withdraw access preempting other to him him  there are to memeorandum memeorandum  for example example  at no no point point has has an investigative story story about about trump trump  s past past business news coverage coverage  written  some good gained traction traction  remember  memeorandum placement placement is based on receiving inbound can  t just just blame caring about  trump trump  s policy trump once very prochoice prochoice  or once singlepayer health health care or once for a a wealth wealth tax tax  seen it don  t care care very things  that may may be be a reasonable supposition supposition  the theory theory has has never have not much emphasis emphasis   trump the system the media media  s selfcriticism trump coverage coverage has focused on s dominance dominance of news cycle for higher higher tv web traffic fine to to debate traffic trump trump is all kinds8 kinds8 but but this this critique for instance instance  with his his ability a tweet news conference conference or  trump prerogative  the press a candidate the media media an explicit part part of of his his strategy the theory some coverage coverage is is almost than none none  s not trump also the media media  s notion objective   trump trump has misogyny and and racism racism  he has and he he has encouraged violence violence against as we fivethirtyeight  these are fact and and not not opinion opinion and and to them otherwise reporting less objective  to avoid them in in those problem is trump  s candidacy candidacy is in precedent precedent  re all to figure figure this this out out as as we we go covering trump trump  but so so have like us here at fivethirtyeight  we laid long odds against trump getting this this far in large large part part because because no presidential candidate candidate has has done done so so since primary and and caucus widespread in in 1972 put another another way trump has the system system and republican party party  that thirdrail like racism racism and and nationalism can still political force force  the media media  s goodwill taken advantage the lack lack of american public public has has in in journalism journalism   trump trump may go away s not gop nomination nomination  be an an underdog in november if he but the the making making  to sort
