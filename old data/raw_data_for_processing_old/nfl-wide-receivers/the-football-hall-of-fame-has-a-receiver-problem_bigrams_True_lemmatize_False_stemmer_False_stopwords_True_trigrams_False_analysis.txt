contact contact with passing output a consequence consequence   the that once quickly became for example example  simple ratio ratio of of league league passing per game game in in one one season the equivalent equivalent of of a yards a what was at the the time time  singleseason yardage total ever to appreciate appreciate a receiver  s true true   talent talent isn isn  t just just about his era era  though  s also his team team  the degree degree to which a a receiver s team relative to to the the league league norm has an an effect a point but somehow isn  t often through the the air give their put up reed  this wasn wasn  major factor his buffalo and washington percent less the league the course course of his career career  to take take 35 yards away but it for someone someone like like calvin calvin johnson johnson  chucked the the ball than average average in in a a league historical norm norm  we treat this adjustment can make make a a huge huge difference difference in in how how a receiver is tried to this issue issue last august by a metric true receiving  try try  with chase chase stuart stuart of of footballperspectivecom footballperspectivecom  can download

player player  s try in lockstep the frequency frequency with with which his team relative to to the the league league average downgraded johnson johnson  production by by 23 percent   because because  despite him breaking the the alltime alltime singleseason singleseason record record for for receiving detroit also the alltime alltime record for pass a season season  wasn  t as simple as to do do so for a a reason reason  because they have a skilled quarterback quarterback andor and so so when when chase chase and and i into it it further further  it became became apparent percent increase increase in in team passing frequency frequency didn lead to to a percent increase individual receiving receiving output instead  we found it was was more more like like a percent increase increase  for any in team saw half in production our difficulty difficulty in the real real effect effect of just how can be other position position  competing with with their their own during a a game in real real time time  makes them them more like basketball and we like carmelo carmelo anthony anthony   who a lot lot of of his his team team  an influence goes beyond having a a receiver receiver who extra attention obvious benefit benefit to to a a team team  s difficult difficult to s true true  trying   the the most statistics are defenseadjusted value value over over average average  dvoa   metric team  success on given player player was the quarterback quarterback as as the measuring performance performance on a peropportunity peropportunity basis basis is baseball  but football football is much more more fluid than baseball baseball  so we run into into a curious phenomenon phenomenon  an opportunity unsuccessful one one  a receiver could be be demonstrating demonstrating a positive ingame ingame influence influence  if not the defense defense and some of of this this phenomenon phenomenon also also is theorem   since their most the very very act a pass pass is is evidence evidence of a player player  s quality offensive threat threat  this  at pertarget like catch catch rate rate and and dvoa dvoa may miss the the bigger bigger picture picture of a player player  full onfield value  taking into into account account how how a receiver is the game when he s not in a successful play play  and then the matter matter of the quality quality of of a receiver
