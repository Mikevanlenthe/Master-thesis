reality it doesn  make it the top top 10 to get get you my colleague colleague andrew tried a sophisticated technique different conclusion conclusion  think the the most most common common name name in in america smith  s how how we first off off  social security security administration ssa  has a a database database of of all back to that date you off off to to a a problem problem  of the the 1746 christened  minnie  in 1880 is still alive today into account account  the number born each year since and  life expectancy expectancy  to figure figure out them are are still boss   nate silver  similar methodology methodology when when he typical age age of in life life expectancy expectancy also for the varying popularity popularity of for instance brittany tend tend to to be be younger younger than ethel  considerable chunk chunk of of people live in in the the us percent of the population population  wasn  t born and their included in in the the ssa s database database of of baby to count count them them  too  by focusing focusing on hispanic or or latino latino  almost half half the the country country  foreignborn population population  the top top 1000 from the found out out how how common common they in each each state state as as of  and and then  correction correction   factor based on on how much more more common common the the name was in methodological detail detail is in the the footnotes1 footnotes1  this way way  to make make sure hispanic and and latino reflected in in the the data data  as a a result result  maria  popular first first name name in in america to the ssa data data   after number of just about about any can see the top top 10 names are the data data  the distribution distribution of to be be more more diffuse diffuse  to use statistical jargon jargon  to be imaginative when when they their baby whole  t very very diverse diverse  percent of the top top 100 list  this was was a a bit bit easier the census census bureau bureau has has a straightforward database database of with each each surname3 surname3 it it was was last in 2000 problem because american nomenclature changed a a lot the past past 14 years  to account this  at the breakdown of of the the us us population population then then and and the breakdown of able to to adjust of each each surname the growth in the name4 so example  the surname surname smith smith is is about white  while the the surname garcia is is 91 hispanic  we then grew since since 2000 at the the same same rate rate as white population population  just over percent  and ditto ditto for for garcia garcia  the hispanic hispanic share share of of those garcia grew grew at the overall hispanic rate rate  reshuffling of the top because the hispanic population a lot faster  than 50 percent  white population this period the end proportional share share of the population that calculation calculation  it was come in in and of fashion fashion  to change change at at a slower rate rate  common surname surname by by a mile is is smith smith  ahead of million with with the the surname surname johnson johnson  tricky bit bit  dividing them them by by the total number people in in the the country country  the chance chance of called  in 100  and the chance chance of the surname surname  smith  is 08 in 100 to figure figure out the probability probability of called   michael michael smith smith  we just those two two to to get get 0008 in 100 here  you  this column column  this methodology methodology is is crap crap  and it s still after all for death  immigration immigration and and population population growth growth  can treat treat a a person person  first name name and and last last name as independent though they nothing to to do do with with each other   but the number particular first first and and lastname lastname combination combination isn isn  two dice dice  related to to each to illustrate illustrate the the point point  let  s use the 20 most common common first first and and last the country country  if you just multiply multiply the for each each of those  you get get a a neat like this this  the first first and and most important reason reason this this is wrong is tie certain first and and last the census census bureau breakdown by racial and ethnic group group  in 2000  999 percent of the surname surname  heimerl  and 990 percent with with the the surname rezendiz  hispanic  are a a lot lot more maria martinez martinez  than  maria miller miller  year  lee hartman hartman  an associate associate professor professor emeritus spanish at illinois university that intuition intuition  simple idea idea  look up first and and lastname the white website and and see captured reality reality  he found the mark mark  didn  the top ssa and and census little different different from but it just how racial and first name thomas  and the the last last name rodriguez  the likelihood likelihood of is independent independent  the chance chance of american being thomas rodriguez rodriguez  is about  and would be called  thomas rodriguez rodriguez  on whitepagescom whitepagescom  hartman found of people people

20 you  a computer computer  even one to factor factor in in ethnicity couldn  t detect detect  no matter matter how the name i don don  t plan calling a a daughter daughter of rose  to change change my my surname surname  wouldn  t go go for for  lott  no offense the 25118 americans with with the the surname surname  john smith smith  of which there are are almost percent fewer fewer in in the
