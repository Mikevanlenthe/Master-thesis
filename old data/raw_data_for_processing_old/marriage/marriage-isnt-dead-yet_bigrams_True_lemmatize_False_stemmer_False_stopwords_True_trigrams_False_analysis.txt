estimate is based on an extrapolation behavior  this is is a fundamental problem problem in all marriage moment in in time time  impossible to whether an person will just hasn hasn  t done done so there  s no no question married later later in in life life   but but most most still least they have so so far far  than 70 percent of married at at least least once by age down from from more more than percent 30 years ago ago but but still solid majority3 majority3 moreover moreover  most of of the in marriage steady  so it reasonable to to assume s 25 follow the the same general path path as those a decade older older  two age the chart chart below the marriage marriage rate4 down by by education education  to 34  the the rate rate has fallen faster faster for those with with a degree   but is a clear downward downward trend trend for for all accelerated since since about people a decade older older  the story story is different  the decline decline is much steeper steeper among

it isn isn  t as strong  the marriage marriage rate rate for for young at most most a high school school diploma diploma is is about higher than than the the rate rate for for those  but but far below the the rate rate for also evidence the divergence divergence in married and and when toward marriage that are are also in a pew survey percent of at most most a high school school diploma  marriage marriage is  versus versus just just 27 percent of of college the survey the division was a similar split split by by income income  by race race  political orientation orientation and smaller7 in
