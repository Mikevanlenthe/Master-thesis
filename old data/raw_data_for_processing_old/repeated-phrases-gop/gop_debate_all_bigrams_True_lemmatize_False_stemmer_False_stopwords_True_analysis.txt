and we bring our going to north korea s wrong being an in a as mr proposing  i do nt know realizes this this  not his but the taken is s why because you you can not be dispute between in which of the acting in the palestinian away from very generous from the  instead what the  they teach their a glorious  they they launch again israel deal between given the of the is not not possible so the the next needs to firmly on on the going to say  s side only proamerican in the blitzer  negotiator  over the it s not a watched him melt down of the i ve ever seen going down a palestinian a real deal  a minute and these tougher than  the are not not a deal  learned a a long not a negotiated with  trump not a not a be able  inaudible and arabs it s not a a real deal  be able senator  be able be able probably the that particular about north north korea raised it posed by north korea  the of american in south that north north korean kim jong un would use a thought his examining a of regime in north north korea getting rid kim jong about regime what it though there so much in north north korea there s reports of uncertainty  what i ought to immediately  ve been kicking the the can nt know intercepting the north korea re not selling this this material giving it someone else  the with the we need need to on north north korea really do on north north korea ought to arming south south korea with ballistic of course with ballistic take a of the the chinese the chinese are the regime down get them where they off  say regime means  involved in in national a long long time out  telling you for any you can be able in north north korea in the put the the chinese we re against them are the being able able to settle this critically important there are are a north korean troops north of the that  south korean the dmz war for it would you know what the there was was an of north north korea  you the can down the going to sooner or in the of the living in nt just put it the table see regime in north north korea perhaps the the chinese chinese can actually accomplish currently the the fact fact is everything to to bear to be we ve unite those that part firmly against against north north korea the ballistic ourselves  what the saying  are now now in of the the horrible approved six ago  going to dollars  we can of these  japan  you from these whether it whether it unit  of these defending saudi before the now they dollars a a day ringing  defend all of these  you have to reimbursed for the military for all of these wolf  mentioned this that the the japanese more  all in that the need to are the of the put the on them do their is no at the to rebuild the military builds the the military in defense need to to rebuild  but a long long time working for performing bureaucratic when we putting   these the military we can deal with with north north korea of all all  that i going to i did i did about israel nt ask i had  now now  is your system of in this horribly wrong had an until i at the the national all of of a said we at your at the the whole did nt at the the next next year the next next year did nt he fact of the is the is not need to get rid there several i talked lot of of people find a did nt on israel a strategic partner for have a judeo christian need to does nt nt mean we ca be fair other people people  we can other people it s a child you want a special for your your own as far far as north korea un is an unstable unstable person understand strength to present to him encouraging the south korea encouraging the the terminal only the the chinese a much need to developing strategic strategic defense he is have nuclear we need need to be able able to ourselves  we should that if a missile be the thing he applause  going to with national from a brokered between really do and the are nt agreeing to are nt nt agreeing is not agreeing  a total it s working  we can nobody else adhering to to be  your on the certainly hopeful that the there s highly skeptical because of in the the middle as we headed to need no no nominate a republican that can a clear and hillary again with both hillary so for for example with the toppling the was a to radical radical islamic endangered america another example voted to as secretary against him supported john him a has been antiisrael secretary ever seen if we agreed with and hillary not in a strong win the the general again  them both very much the fact called for impeached  him a called for impeached  early  that subject so much were in if these politicians went to the did nt nt do thing  had saddam had gadhafi  instead over the  all all right were bad really bad we do we re right now now  over their it s a total have been if the took a a day going into into war on the the libya did nt nt topple toppled gadhafi that this had to it happen a long long time argued if a long long time like these these radical to take of the where the senator cruz to agree why  another day day hillary absolutely horrible somebody even her  to amaze i would south korea is important asking to to be saying these need to a year well  s why why our that regional is so so critical from them will become become nuclear  they they can quickly  will do if the the american away  to rebuild the military why we from our our asiapacific said walk nt want i want us much we can subsidize  how much get  has been tougher critic the worst in the get their the other for this hold on it s toppling gadhafi that in on our you can hear the from donald that interview maybe he about it apologize where that s

with with 11 countries in in the the pacific pacific  you ve deal  trump  yeah  baker  the one table  trump  it s horrible deal deal  trade is boosted growth growth  and every every single war president president has the expansion international trade trade  the last reverse more more than years of of us trade policy policy  the tpp tpp is horrible deal deal  it is is a a deal nothing but trouble  it s a deal that was for china china to to come come in as they through the the back back door door and take advantage everyone  it s long  so complex read it it s s like like obamacare  nobody read it  they passed it  nobody read it and look look at at mess mess we and it it will this is is one worst trade and i i would have it with all and all the bad getting advantage advantage and taking advantage advantage of the good get  much better better  a fortune fortune on with everybody we re billion in of imbalance imbalance with with china billion a year imbalance imbalance with with japan japan  by the the way way  billion a year imbalance imbalance  so i must say say  gerard  i just just think think it it s terrible deal deal  i love free trader trader  percent   but making the and we we do do nt have smart smart people the the the deal deal  the deal published just just last week  pages of of it percent of of us trade with the pacific pacific  these 11 countries  tarifffree  trade deal the other percent  which are the deal trump  the currency currency manipulation manipulation they do nt nt discuss the agreement agreement  a disaster disaster  if you china and and india india and and almost almost everybody takes advantage particular  because they re so so good good  s the the numberone numberone abuser this country country  and if if you the way take advantage advantage  it s through currency currency manipulation manipulation  it s discussed in in the the almost  000page agreement  it s discussed   baker baker  a separate separate separate separate   crosstalk crosstalk  trump  and as as you mean  understand very very well wall street journal   currency currency manipulation the single single great great weapon weapon people have  it in in this this agreement agreement  so i say  it s a very very bad bad deal deal  if it it is it will just be be more more bad bad trade loss of of jobs our country country  we are like nobody s ever ever lost lost jobs jobs before before  want to jobs back this country country  paul  gerard   you might want want to to point china is this deal deal  true  it s s true true  bartiromo  right  right  paul   before before we we get little bit bit offkilter baker  that is is nt part of of the the problem problem   senator if if if this this deal deal is is not by by by the the us the senate senate  then it it would give china china an an opportunity to grow economic leadership leadership  it s to do the us part in in this this trade trade deal china will the lead lead  paul  an argument that china the deal deal  because in in us the deal deal  we ll ll be right   but but i think we we ve ve sort sort of the point point a little bit is an important point point  though  about how how we these trade do agree agree with mr trump trump on we should should negotiate a position position of of strength strength  and we we also the full full force constitutional power to us i think think it a mistake give up up power the presidency these trade give up the power power to to filibuster filibuster  and i m kind of fond fond of power   laughter give up the power power to amend  and i i think think  one of of the the big our country country is last century century  much power power has gravitated to to the executive branch branch  congress is is kind kind of a bystander bystander  we do do nt the laws executive branch in trade trade and and i i am for trade trade i think we we should should be be careful careful about power to to the the presidency presidency  applause  thank you you   senator

side of having more more  s good in addition addition to  wolf wolf  a big big problem problem  it s called encryption encryption  people in in san san bernardino communicating with with people the fbi watching   but because their their phone phone was the intelligence talking to it was was lost lost  the encryption encryption problem problem  it is is not a president president of of the has to bring people people together together  a position position  to be to penetrate these people people when when they and we give the the ability ability to to penetrate penetrate to disrupt  we need  encryption encryption is is a a major major problem problem  and congress congress has to deal deal with with this this and and so the president president to keep us safe  blitzer  thank you you  the fight and isis isis has has been war of of our our time so let let s s talk about how how each each of of you you  as commander commander in in chief chief  war and and win win it senator cruz cruz  said you carpet bomb bomb isis isis into into oblivion quote   sand can glow glow in in the the dark dark  the isis capital of of raqqa raqqa in in syria cruz  overwhelming air air power destroy isis isis  perspective  in the persian gulf gulf war war  day  we carpet for 36 days   saturation  after in and and in in a day and and a a half was left the iraqi iraqi army army  obama is between 15 and 30 day  it is is photo photo op op foreign foreign policy to use overwhelming air air power power  to be to be fighting and killing isis and let let me me go go back back to to the earlier discussion minute ago ago  it s s not a lack lack of of competence the obama obama administration political correctness correctness  nt monitor monitor the the facebook posting of female san san bernardino bernardino terrorist the obama obama dhs be inappropriate inappropriate  public call call to and they nt target target it the tsarnaev the elder elder brother public call call to jihad and and the the obama obama administration nt target target it anwar alawlaki alawlaki  radical cleric cleric  jihad against against his his fellow the problem problem is is because political correctness correctness  the obama obama administration like a a lot want to to search search everyone everyone s s cell focus on on the the bad political correctness correctness is  blitzer blitzer  thank you you  to be  senator senator cruz cruz  would you you carpet carpet bomb bomb raqqa the isis capital  there are are a a lot lot of cruz  carpet bomb city  the location air power and you to direction direction the the air power   but but the the object to level level a a city the object object is is to the isis  isis isis is gaining strength strength because because the the perception perception is they re and president president obama that perception perception  will change change when the globe globe see when you join isis you are your life life  you are your death death warrant warrant  a president president who defeating every every single single isis isis terrorist terrorist and the homeland homeland  be the first priority priority  blitzer  thank you you  thank you you  senator   senator senator rubio rubio  you ve critical of of senator senator cruz cruz s s strategy strategy  his voting voting record nt match match his rhetoric  why  rubio  me begin begin by that we to understand who isis isis is  isis isis is radical sunni sunni group group  can not just be through air key component component of them   but but they must be the ground ground by by a ground force force  ground force force must must be of sunni sunni arabs sunni arabs reject them them to to help help them them with training  to help help them them conduct and to to help improve the the air the air important  air force capable of of it and because the budget facing in this country country  we are to be be left the oldest oldest and and the smallest air air force force we have ever to reverse reverse those in addition to the navy and and in in addition to the our army army  and beyond that  i would say we we must the information information war against isis isis  every war war we have ever ever been in has informational aspect aspect to  isis isis is the propaganda propaganda war war  they are people  them  with the the promise that they they are this great apocalyptic movement to defeat defeat the west  to show life is in isis isis territory territory  and we them why why isis isis is is not invincible  going out out and publicizing them them to to those those who they recruit recruit  blitzer  because i the question question  senator   because because you this  said he to senator senator cruz cruz  the defense defense authorization act every it came came up and i i assume if he against it he would would veto veto it as president president  s the the bill rubio  is accurate the defense defense authorization authorization act which is is a a bill the way way  the iron iron dome dome and and other and i that if you vote vote against against it the senate senate  also veto veto it as president president  he has has also by the the way way  that is the containment containment budget budget  is a a budget reduce the the amount of money money we military  nt carpet carpet bomb bomb isis isis if if you do nt attack them them with with  we continue continue those we re to mention mention additional going to to be be left the oldest oldest and and the smallest air air force force this this country country has has ever safe  blitzer   senator senator cruz cruz  cruz  and he re not is true national defense defense authorization authorization act act  because when when i in texas texas i that i i would federal government the authority authority to to detain detain us with no due process process  an effort that out out of bill  and i campaign commitment commitment  cruz   but  you the notion notion marco marco is suggesting  somehow  he also than a a few this direction direction  let s s be  isis isis and islamic terrorism terrorism will will face face no foe than than i i will destroy them them by the bad and one marco s s foreign foreign policy policy is is he he has has far far too hillary clinton clinton and and barack barack obama middle east to focus focus on getting stuck stuck in keep america safe  blitzer   senator senator rubio rubio  of distinction first is if you american citizen citizen and and you decide to to join join up with isis isis  we re re not to read your miranda you re to be as an an enemy combatant  a member member of an army this country country  two  our defense is a a fact cuts we we are and the senator cruz cruz would with an smaller air air force force and the one one we we are to be be left left with with  final point that i hillary clinton clinton and and barack barack obama obama s s strategy strategy is is to to lead from behind behind  he is to lead lead at at all can not not continue continue to to outsource outsource foreign foreign policy policy  must lead lead  we are powerful nation the world world  to begin begin to to act like it applause  blitzer  we are much more more on on this this  paul   wolf

country the law law is first  prove it them  this has has been clear   every every effort the last to do do those and it it has american people have zero zero trust federal government government will that s s why why since since then then  if you serious about about immigration immigration reform reform  then the the key the door door to to do is not just to to pass pass a a law says it it is to enforce enforce the the law law  do it to hire hire the the 20 new border finish the fencing and in place place mandatory mandatory everify everify  in place place an an entryexit tracking system to prevent prevent visa and once in place place and working  believe the american people people will will support support a a very reasonable  responsible approach approach to to people long time time  who pay and pay but until then   none none of going to to be possible  muir  you fight fight for the legislation the time time or did you run from from it it as as you rubio  the legislation passed   but but it it has has no no support in essence essence  it could could nt nt pass pass in in the the house house  it will never pass pass in in the we secure secure the the border border  is not the way way we we re to do do when when i m president president  when i m president president  we are to enforce enforce the the law first  prove to to people illegal immigration immigration is is under

you  martha  raddatz   senator senator cruz cruz  what you you call call carpet or saturation to defeat defeat isis isis  citing the the more more than than 1 the us carried out during the gulf war war in in 1991 explain how how a a strategy strategy to to defeat defeat a standing army army would would work work against terrorist group hiding amongst the population population  cruz   sure sure  a commanderinchief objective  objective has has to destroying isis isis  has nt started with objective and  once once you have the first tool tool is overwhelming air air power power  it is is one america  military on the face the earth earth  is we the ability ability to that air power  as you persian gulf gulf war war  it was was 1 day  obama is between 15 and 30 now  say saturation saturation carpet bombing  is not indiscriminate  at oil targeted at at the the oil targeted at at command command and and control at infrastructure infrastructure  it s targeted at bombing all going in in and raqqa  it s overwhelming air air power power  couple of it was a facility facility is jihadist university university  the question question i i wonder wonder  building still standing  it should should be rubble  and if if you a president president  rings  cruz  though i i will say this this  i would would be to wait wait until freshman orientation raddatz   senator senator cruz cruz  would you you like like to to expand expand or engagement  i was was just just over a command command center center in in erbil and they worked   because because you areas  want to to hit cruz  martha  i will active duty military   with the state state of hampshire  we are immoral  we are sending them them into into fight with their their back back  can not and it it is wrong  cruz  and i i will this   look look  america has reluctant to to use military force force  s the the last last step we take take  but if if and and when when we it when when it defeating isis isis  we should should use use it we should should use overwhelming force force  the enemy enemy and and then the heck heck out out  do nt nt engage instead  allow our do their their jobs jobs instead instead of making it accomplish the objective  raddatz  loosen the engagement  cruz  raddatz   senator senator rubio rubio  the last last debate that isis isis is is the the most jihadist group group in the history history of mankind and force to to defeat defeat them them  can you mean by overwhelming force force  rubio  first  to understand understand who they are  isis isis is is not just a a jihadist jihadist group group  apocalyptic group group  to trigger showdown in in a a city between the west and believe will will trigger trigger the the arrival messianic figure figure  going to happen  the reason reason why it s important to to understand that is these are are not just going going to to go go away own  they are defeated  and i believe they to be on the the ground ground  by a ground force force  sunni arabs arabs  reject them will require require a a coalition coalition of of iraqis iraqis and that are but it it will also require require the the cooperation cooperation of should ask more of of the the saudis saudis  to be with more more us special operation them  and it it will to be up with and we we are strike them them  just in iraq and and in in syria syria  in every part of of the the world where they of operation operation  this planet planet  have a sophisticated network network of radicalizing people the homeland homeland and the world world  but it it all their their their safe a ground ground force usled coalition raddatz   again  senator senator rubio rubio  ve already said isis isis is is the the most dangerous jihadist jihadist group the history history of mankind  make it dangerous than than al al qaida qaida   the in iraq iraq  troops to if isis isis is is the the most dangerous group group in in history history  why not not commit commit a a large large us ground force force  rubio   because because they liberated and and held held by by sunnis if they by shias shias it it will will trigger sectarian violence violence   the and they they will can not not and want to to liberate liberate and rubio  it will take sunni that region region to and then then to them and the sort sort of sectarian violence the past past  that is is important important is is because because if if sunnis sunnis are are not able to you are have a a successor successor group group to to isis  isis isis is is a a successor successor group group of of al al qaida qaida  in fact fact  from al al qaida qaida  because as horrible as as al al qaida  isis isis thought thought al al qaida qaida was radical enough enough  this is is who we re with  and they have more more money money than than al al qaida qaida ever bush  martha  martha  if i raddatz  would you you do would you you do to try try to to get those sunni have not coming forward forward  rubio  the problem problem with with the the sunni the region region is is they do nt nt trust trust this this administration this administration a deal the shia shia  in iran iran  the well very difficult difficult to to cooperate cooperate with with them them as as a a result result  the way way  real us us air like  iraq war war  close  afghanistan   they what air when the committed to to the the cause cause   and that s s not  commitment commitment  real commitment the  jordanian king king was in washington told everyone everyone who that they for permission the coalition coalition to to target the coalition coalition  leadership on on the the ground ground  rings  allow them raddatz  mr trump trump  thank you you very much   senator senator rubio rubio  mr trump trump  applause

rubio rubio  let me me first first talk about justice his loss tremendous and hearts and go out out to he will down as as one the great the history history of republic   you about someone someone who meaning of the constitution constitution  the constitution constitution was was not to be based on on the the moment moment  but it it was there to to be according to justice scalia scalia understood better than than anyone the history history of republic  his dissent dissent  for example independent counsel counsel case case is is a brilliant piece piece of of jurist jurist work work  course  his dissent dissent on number two two  i do do not believe the the president president should should appoint appoint someone someone  s not fact  it has has been been over years since since a duck

barack barack obama hillary clinton clinton on on foreign foreign policy policy  one of of the the real both donald donald and and senator senator rubio rubio is that they hillary clinton clinton and

someone who much of his life life in in law law enforcement enforcement  believe you and evidence ending up with the the verdict verdict  of the massive surveillance surveillance on that was a very development  s why why the correct it the same same time time  i said said in initial statement the evidence edward snowden the law law  he should should be violating the the law law   since since
