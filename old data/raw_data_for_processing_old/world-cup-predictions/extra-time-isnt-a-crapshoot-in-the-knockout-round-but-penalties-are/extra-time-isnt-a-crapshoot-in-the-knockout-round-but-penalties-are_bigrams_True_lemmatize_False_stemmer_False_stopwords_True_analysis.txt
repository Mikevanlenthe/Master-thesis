percent  smaller if extra time time is is drawn and the to win win is is on has just just a percent chance chance of prevailing at that point point  we estimate estimate  where the the difference is larger the favorite of an an edge edge  argentina and and algeria algeria  for example example  have about about a a 350point elorating difference difference  have a percent chance chance of such a a game game after it went went to extra time time  however  its edge quite small small  it would about a a 6040 favorite  if the the game game went went to the knockout the world world cup cup  however  the favorite favorite is to win during regulation regulation play this adjustment adjustment doesn make all practical difference difference  based on rather than than elo as an favorite under our new
