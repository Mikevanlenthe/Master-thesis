but but brazil brazil  s edge edge is is not homefield advantage the challenge challenge of international soccer we insist insist on a purist purist  s approach first  we look those since since the

look topflight competition competition  for this this year year  s world world cup cup  each team team  s record record in as follows4 first problem the small small sample brazil and and germany just six six of the almost almost four africa  example  a lot lot worse worse  four  two   cameroon cameroon and all  this isn isn  list  in fact brazil  argentina   spain germany emerge emerge as as a top four four  the other other big big problem problem is all of such as in world world cup held in in brazil brazil last year and by the the home home team team  was the the major major exception record of promising  for instance instance  but all played against against the the three mexico  and costa costa rica rica  s pretty pretty well the us the better better of of costa costa rica rica and can hold mexico  doesn  t say can beat beat germany germany  ghana or portugal  much information about how national soccer against one one another another when when they the most most on the line line  s why why they the world world cup cup  of course course   but t very helpful in to anticipate anticipate the the tournament tournament  outcome  quick introduction introduction to to spi spi i spi to to address some of spi is is a a little complex as with something our ncaa basketball projection projection model model  complexity isn isn  thing when when it forecasting model model  may require require more computational power power  takes a time to to run run  and more more time time to to prepare prepare and clean data data  to link international competition competition  the state state of of soccer soccer data data  be less less transparent transparent and and harder harder to to explain explain  to be be said said for for a simple model to be long as can point point out out when when and to occur occur  said  ve been with spi spi  and since since  s less complex in in principle principle than than in in practice it are are as predictive  rather than retrospective  s not reward teams good play play  to guess guess who a match played tomorrow tomorrow  of importance based on on the the composition composition of taken quite such as as if if a a team team is against a historic rival rival  or if if it a tuneup tuneup before before an tournament  blown off off if if a a team team has has already its position position  is sufficient sufficient data data to to do do so a team team has best lineup lineup in in the the game game by comparing it it against against the in the the most wasn  for instance instance  because it pulled all all the helped it it win win the the world world cup offensive and some basketballrating ken pomeroy pomeroy  offensive and ratings are meant to to reflect reflect how a team team would would score score and allow if if it an average international team5 team5 a defensive rating rating is is therefore therefore better better  while a rating is is good good  soccer is is a a fluid fluid sport sport  so offense offense and and defense defense aren to separate separate  nevertheless  this way particular  ve found predictive power power than elite competition competition  played in in the the world world cup cup  this may may reflect reflect the the fact can result result from running up the score score against inferior competition competition  the  big four four  year   germany germany is having a prolific offense offense but back line in addition international club england   spain germany  italy and and  year   france france  the europa europa league league  rate their assigning a a plusminus to each each player the pitch pitch for for a match  detail  the plusminus plusminus system isn  because the the data data isn isn  t either either  a lot lot of a player player is in the starting lineup for fc fc barcelona barcelona or or chelsea fair amount him  spi is is two rolled into into one one   one national team team  s play play  and one composite of of player be a a team team  top lineup lineup  the two correlated with with one  but some minor for instance instance  something like the world national team team  s play play  but spi spi has has us lower because the contrast contrast would would be be a a team team like like france france  national team been inconsistent inconsistent  but it a lot talent  may or or may may not come together together  tiny bit housekeeping about about spi interactive  first  in addition offensive and defensive rating rating  each team team also overall spi rating  for instance instance  for spain spain  what percentage a team team would would accumulate6 accumulate6 if if it a roundrobin roundrobin against against every national team team  this definition fairly obscure the more interesting question question is is about about a a team team  face in in brazil these are are also interactive  for instance instance  has a percent chance chance of ghana and and a percent chance chance of with it ll be the conclusion conclusion of of each each match7 a lot more detail available on on spi the main main improvement improvement in in the the model model since pattani and and his at espn a lot more work to predict predict the the distribution distribution of these match based on resemble the the world world cup cup  competitive  the top top 100 inflated bivariate bivariate poisson poisson regression regression to the distribution distribution of the fancy fancy math math is necessary because scored and allowed are qualifying out of world world cup knowing the the chance chance of compared to to a win or or a win is  travel travel distance distance and and south south america vs europe europe we we also a lot lot of of research research into travel distance above and and beyond beyond homefield homefield advantage advantage  is it important  for instance instance  much less less far far to to brazil brazil than than russia russia or or japan ambiguous  we found first of of all eastwest distance more than than northsouth northsouth distance distance  in other geographic advantage advantage may the avoidance avoidance of of jet jet lag rather than than the mere fact fact of to home home  however  we also while the the travel travel effect effect was significant when based on on all all world world cup dating back back to much less significant in from the the era era for which spi spi has data  late 2006 onward   this this may may be international travel travel has and the the notion home country country is little different different in a period period when when most most of of the brazil or or argentina now play play in a lot lot of of debate to include include a strong   adjustment eastwest distance  one based on on data data from weak   adjustment  one based on on the much weaker signal from onward  or not to include include it it at at all all  and wound wound up going with with the the weak weak adjustment the weak weak adjustment little difference difference  it might the advancement a team japan by by a couple of of percentage for instance instance  you  ll notice is nevertheless the south just brazil brazil  spi is is also chile  uruguay and and colombia the same same was true in in 2010  when when uruguay uruguay and were good the system the south for this this year year  s world world cup compiled 16 wins  losses and and 14 played since since the the completion the last last world world cup cup   all so they they may may not informative   nevertheless spi is placing a a big big bet the notion the level level of of competition in south south

chile has has been been prone prone to playing well well against against weaker weaker competition competition but but not the world world  elite  could be be a fluke or or it it could could be real
