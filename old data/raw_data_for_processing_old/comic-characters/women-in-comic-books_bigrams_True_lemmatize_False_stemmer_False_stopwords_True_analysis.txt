online  a newcomer newcomer  with the the ninth ninth issue coming out out midoctober midoctober and and a paperback collection coming soon soon  marvel  assumed she become the at marvel marvel  said  was not our radar radar  ms marvel marvel is is one one of just 3599 marvel  s universe arrive at pulled data data from from the the marvel marvel and and dc dc wikia so as as with with any any data data of this nature take it it with the standard standard caveat as good good as the people it5 still these two the best this kind kind of of information information  a list list of of characters6 characters6 from from the the two two mainstream of each each publisher7 publisher7 this this left left me me with with 6896 dc and marvel   once once i the list list of interest  i also on each each wikia8 wikia8  sex and and sexuality hair color color  eye color color  whether the neutral  whether they whether they alive or dead9 the the wikias wikias also also count number of character in in the able to to pull pull appearance the dc characters10 since since i m also in how female representation changed over over time time  month and year of of the first issue issue each each character in11 i got firstappearance firstappearance data data for for 6827 one appearance appearance  which we have gender gender data12 made up percent of of the the dc dc character character list list and percent of of the the marvel marvel roster the same same trend out when when we we look look at higher appearance when we we zero zero in the 2415 dc and and 3342 with gender at least least 10 times  the set set of the most most consistent consistent view what we we see the page page  make up percent of of the the dc dc universe universe and percent of of the the marvel marvel universe13 when we we focus the most each universe the show the data or more percent of of dc s are female  similar 311 percent of of the the marvel marvel crowd crowd is says one possible reason reason we see dc dc with with a slight advantage marvel in in the raw character dc was create female supergirl  etc  while marvel when marvel its mainstream it was was for for example example  spiderwoman and and shehulk shehulk  said  eyed as stake out spiderwoman   cancellation cancellation in in 1983 after 50 issues was  miller miller said said  single line line of of text ending  a story story page that spiderwoman existed in in the the marvel marvel universe that everyone everyone would her  so we speaking  the two two big awesome relationship changed  at each year since the year modern marvel can see number of introduced each each year for each counting up the aggregate aggregate number male  female and and gender characters15   more more on on gender gender and released each can figure figure out the state state of of gender gender parity changed over over time time in in each each universe come closer closer to to gender gender parity parity  but each each still difficulttoovercome imbalance can then then get annual rate rate of the percentage percentage of introduced each each year year who female  pivot toward toward diversity marvel nor nor dc dc is a rate approaching gender gender parity while each publisher is don  t reflect reflect reality16 make up about half half the the population population  been some negative reaction reaction from from longtime the industry industry  move to to include  marvel published one one letter the story story change change in thor  can  t recall recall another another moment my perception perception of particular creator creator  quickly and and so  wrote wrote oscar oscar nunez nunez  to call call the the new new thor gimmick  you  course and and so this one one longtime diehard fan fan  think if if we new character character is pick up the hammer hammer and and it a random i don don  think we we would the same same backlash i think think just just the the fact it was female character a lot lot to to do do with that  disappointing  the backlash backlash hasn hasn  the book being one the topselling straight  when we we look another unfortunate unfortunate picture s evidence women are passive than the page secret identity the marvel marvel universe percent of percent of while in in the the dc dc universe percent of had a secret identity percent of while it s not perfect standin standin  can also to be rather than than just just normal normal  the dc dc universe in both both dc dc and and marvel marvel  neutral allegiance allegiance at higher rate rate than to be be bad bad in in each each universe fact  combined  in other a paucity sought to to introduce introduce more more gay gay  lesbian  bisexual and and transgender both dc dc and and marvel categorized a character as as lgbt lgbt  gender and and sexualminority have been while it a blip blip in the whole whole data data set the chart chart below recent introduction introduction of of lgbt the work work to to get get more and more comics  going on into how the page page  discussing each each and and every every one and while while it s not  people people are talking about the new new thor thor and and ms ms marvel marvel because because they feel change change is an industry industry and and community both aaron aaron and and wilson wilson credit much of of this this change change to to the leap forward forward as as people the industry
