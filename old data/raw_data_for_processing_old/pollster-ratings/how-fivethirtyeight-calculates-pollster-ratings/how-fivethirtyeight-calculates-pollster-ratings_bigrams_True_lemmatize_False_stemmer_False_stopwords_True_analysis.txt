major set set of of pollster june 2010 and made a cursory cursory update the 2012 elections  happened  when you publish a a set set of of pollster people are upon how how you you  individual polling pollster xyz xyz better better than than pollster pollster pdq pdq  the pollster give you a better better basis basis for individual polling than 300 of them our database database  the point point  the bigpicture measured by by how predict election pollster performance predictable  are a a pollster pollster  s past the better better predictor predictor  or are the short short answer answer is that pollster pollster performance performance is predictable  some extent extent  noisy and and bad can get lucky  but pollster pollster performance performance is predictable on something like like the major league league baseball that analogy in baseball baseball  much difference difference in in an an absolute absolute sense between a hitter and and a hitter  getting about about one extra hit during each week of the baseball baseball season season  poll accuracy that large large  the very percentage point point more more accurate the average average pollster over the long run run  the average average poll our database final election election outcome the best best poll poll would be off off by points  s almost to take take an an average average of for any any one them to hit a a bullet bullet with a bullet bullet  the very very worst well  we estimate the absolute to 3 points of of error error  with average poor methodology methodology  worse  below average average  than the the best above average average  there are to how how accurate accurate any any poll can be because of sampling error error and and other no shortage shortage of but just just as as most most baseball  most to be be about about average average  least  s the the best best guess can make based on their past poll accuracy take a time to to converge mean  t assume polling firm awesome just just because because it the most most recent recent election election any than you a shortstop shortstop who one day for a a 400 hitter   nonetheless nonetheless  when you you aggregate a number the sample become larger larger  you  ll find some consistency consistency in in pollster pollster performance performance  we go go any d encourage encourage you to download download the the database database of that we to construct construct the the pollster making it first time time  the database with just just a a few describe below below  every poll in the the last three weeks weeks of presidential  senate  gubernatorial campaign campaign since along with final three three weeks caucuses since everything out agree with with some our approach approach and disagree with  better better yet yet  a bunch bunch of we hadn hadn  to look for  we think should be be more more pollster fivethirtyeight shouldn shouldn  the last last word them  simplest measure measure of of poll poll accuracy is how how far far the the poll poll  s margin margin was actual election election result result  for instance instance  if a a poll the democrat democrat ahead ahead by won by points  would represent represent a a 7point error  in the below   average average error through 2007  and and again the same onward  about half half the our database database are or later later  so this this is logical dividing dividing point point  the list the 28 firms with with at polls in in both the sample sample  can see see  a fair fair amount of consistency consistency in the correlation correlation coefficient coefficient  is a perfect correlation correlation and no correlation correlation  is about insideradvantage and american research research group the least least accurate the sample sample  the washington washington post post  among the the most most accurate like espn espn and by the the walt walt disney disney company company   but a number want to to account for  particular  want to know how much of of the the error to do do with for instance instance  more error error than this is is a a consequence consequence of for instance instance  turnout is is far t the  fault fault  baseball analogy analogy  hitting in in dodger dodger stadium clayton kershaw kershaw  how do do we we account these  some work work  the balance balance of this article article will our process process  year  a variety variety of the pollster simple to to more complex  if at any point point you think we ve made made one one assumption many  can take take the the exit exit ramp ramp and one of can download download the the raw raw data data and and construct overall method method is the same same as as in in 2010 year  for the the first first time time  a consideration consideration of of a a poll in addition addition to past accuracy the case case for doing so so has grown stronger stronger since since then then  can find a number the pollster based on on past past accuracy accuracy alone alone if if you prefer them them  there are are also come to to think differently since first  the case case against much weaker the last last four time   the the most prominent internet internet pollster pollster was interactive  it has has since since been as jz poor methodology methodology and but internet internet penetration penetration has considerably since since then then  telephone penetration penetration  along  in 2012  the better than the telephone a group group  to telephone skeptical of of internet do not use probability sampling   but but the the fivethirtyeight fivethirtyeight pollster longer include include an an explicit explicit penalty for internet internet polls1 polls1 as as they in 2010 second  become harder harder to distinguish a partisan  poll  as i this month month  fivethirtyeight has has been relaxed standard standard for we define define as partisan  polls since the challenge challenge in trying to to use restrictive standard many borderline and we we didn didn  to make make a a lot lot of of ad  some some polling public policy  conduct behalf of but pay pay for kos and isn  t clear clear who paying for for a a poll poll  the most sponsored by by party national committee committee  the fivethirtyeight fivethirtyeight forecast but we we still keep track track of we don don  our forecast results are the pollster polls are with a partisan  the database2 database2 the the idea idea is polling firm be held for any any poll poll it public consumption consumption  if a polling firm biased and and inaccurate behalf of reflected in rating  if it better work work when behalf of media organization our pollster ratings database database also couple of potential bias the term term bias bias itself much a polling firm firm  toward one one party party or the other other as actual election effect  by contrast contrast  to how how a a firm firm  if pollster pollster pdq the democrat democrat ahead ahead by points in in an an election the race tied  it would democratic house house effect effect  the democrat to win win by points   pdq pdq would republican bias bias as actual election the case case for of poll poll accuracy bias and and house statistical noise systematic  be a  third third  clearer evidence evidence of of pollster pollster  herding  herding is is the the tendency some polling to be issuing poll might want want to to avoid a poll poll if if it that poll poll to to be be an an outlier it might poor methodology ad hoc its poll poll is is more more in in line line with with a a stronger stronger one the problem problem with herding is  independence independence   one one benefit benefit of can account the extreme extreme case honest pollster pollster in the field field and and a at the polling firm firm  own  for instance instance  if the honest poll poll has has the the democrat democrat up by 6 points  the democrat democrat as ahead by between 4 and 8 points  in this this case case  just one one poll any information information  else is is just just a a reflection reflection of and if if the honest poll to go wrong  so will will everyone else  s results3 persuasive evidence herding has general election election  to be be more more common common among may make make an individual polling polling firm firm  worse  tentative evidence this is happening  polling database database  first   how the average individual poll poll was was  and second second   how polling average average was4 was4 i the analysis general election conducted   from through 2007 the average average poll poll in final margin margin by the average average error has been onward   but but the polling average average hasn hasn  any better better  worse   from through 2007  the the polling polling average final margin margin in an election election by by an an average the error error has has been this is something we concerned about about  the benefit benefit of decline if to increase increase  couple of to account account for behavior  now let let  s get get into into the follows is is a comprehensive description description of of how we calculate calculate the the pollster step 1 collect and and classify the work work is is in this step ve spent represented in in the the pollster three simple in 1998 or later later  conducted in final three three weeks the campaign campaign  in one the following course  s not a number come up from time time to to time time   sample missing from from older a poll poll  s sample size from of error error or from how many people people a polling firm surveyed in in other sample size size was was listed5 listed5 as last resort resort  we use as a a default sample size size  if a a pollster we list voter version the database database  the database three weeks weeks of the campaign campaign and and almost almost all time  almost all the database database should should be when a a pollster the same same survey survey  for example example  the poll poll with with and a thirdparty thirdparty candidate fivethirtyeight  s policy policy is to average however  our database taken from the treatment treatment of be inconsistent inconsistent  included  such as as in in louisiana louisiana  popular vote vote and and the congressional ballot ballot are included7 the the use for instance instance  if a a firm final tracking tracking poll poll was conducted on on the the friday through the the sunday an election election  we wouldn wouldn  also list list the the version saturday  polls are the database if they in the the fivethirtyeight fivethirtyeight forecasts8 forecasts8 a a poll poll  s date date as the database median date date the the poll poll was the field field  the poll poll was released  example  a poll from oct to oct oct 22 released on on oct as oct general all final three three weeks weeks of a campaign campaign are included  there are the case case of the new new hampshire primary are after the the iowa iowa caucus caucus has has been and no beyond new new hampshire hampshire are new hampshire hampshire has has voted9 fivethirtyeight  with huffpost huffpost pollster pollster  the internet archive   and data sent sent to to us sought to to verify in fact released to to the public in in advance of each each election10 the pollster pollster did did not cherrypick the to us ve chosen the cutoff cutoff point point because that election that the the data data ought ought to to be comprehensive   nevertheless the database database  any number that we releasing the the data data publicly publicly will allow people people to to check omissions11 a a big big challenge in how how to the pollster pollster we we associate with each each survey survey  for instance instance  marist college to conduct as marist marist college else  the answer answer is marist college our policy policy is is to the poll poll with with the the pollster pollster itself itself rather the media media sponsor sponsor  however  a few few media new york have inhouse our goal goal is is to associate the the poll the company our estimation estimation  contributed the the most intellectual property property to to the the survey survey  s methodology methodology  for instance instance  the set set of this year year by by yougov for cbs new york classified as as yougov cbs newsnew newsnew york operate under multiple brand or subtract cases are clear  for instance instance  reports is is a subsidiary of pulse opinion opinion research research  under each each name name are together   other cases are had to best judgment judgment about polling firm the pollster ratings  for telephone telephone and and internet the same company  for instance instance  they  the database database  this is impractical as internet and and telephone together  or otherwise otherwise fail differentiate one one mode from the the other other  for now grandfathered in ipsos and to list their internet internet and and telephone as separate this will will very change with with the the next major release the pollster database after after the the 2014  step step 2 calculate simple simple average average error this part part  simple  we compare compare the the margin the poll poll against the election election result result and see how far apart apart they the poll republican to to win points and and he by 9 instead  a 5point preferred source for election leip  the error error is based on on the the margin top two the election election  top two the poll poll  for instance instance  if a certain poll the 2008 democratic caucus caucus with hillary clinton clinton at percent   barack barack obama obama with with 30 percent and and john percent  d look much it obama to to win win over edwards since since they the top top two third  the database database also a column a poll poll  called  the winner the race but we we think think this this is poor measure measure of of poll poll accuracy a race the democrat democrat won won by percentage point point  a poll winning by by 1 point did did a good job job  whereas one the democrat by 13 the mark mark  step 3 calculate simple simple plusminus plusminus as as i conducive to to accurate particular  with accurate challenging to to poll14 congress and governor are between  this step to account that consideration consideration along along with with a couple of of other run a a regression regression analysis polling error based on on the the type type of of election surveyed15 a a poll poll  s sample sample size16 of days17 the poll the election18 election18 we we then then calculate calculate a a plusminus plusminus score score by comparing a a poll poll  s average average error the error error one for instance instance  quinnipiac university an average average error by comparison comparison  the average average pollster pollster  the same the same with the the same sizes  an error error of according to to the the regression regression  quinnipiac therefore simple plusminus plusminus score score of this is is a a good good score score  as in in golf golf  indicate betterthanaverage betterthanaverage performance performance  been 07 about the the other the past past  the error error in resulting from sampling error temporal error error and pollsterinduced error error  they are by a a sum sum of formula  total\\ error\\sqrt error\\sqrt  sampling\\ error error

expect  a poll poll of final margin the race race by by an an average because of sampling error error alone in a a state state with with 10 million voters19 sampling error error isn t the have to to worry about  concern is almost  on election election day refer to to this this property temporal  or timedependent timedependent  error  important news the 48 to 72 the election election  such as as the the new new hampshire primary debate debate in in 2008 the revelation revelation of of george george w w bush bush  the 2000 presidential election election  the outcome outcome of three weeks weeks in evaluating pollster pollster accuracy accuracy  well  there are to balance the possibility the overwhelming overwhelming majority majority of not feature important latebreaking mediahyped   game but they much difference difference upon careful analysis analysis  see above above  prominent in final few an election common for for a a pollster publish some can affect affect media media coverage the campaign campaign  in line line  final poll poll  apparent movement movement in in the the late the election election is artificial  reflecting response response bias bias  a certain certain candidate to respond respond to the candidate candidate has has a public opinion  election election day a misnomer misnomer   many mail or voting  in the the 2012 presidential election election  about onequarter of the cast before before nov final three three weeks the campaign sample size size  three weeks weeks is is an arbitrary cutoff cutoff point point  profound objection the interval interval to month or it to to two two weeks weeks  different standard standard for but we we feel evaluating a polling firm firm  s accuracy very last last poll poll is a mistake mistake  the pollster ratings account the fact polling on on the the eve the election doing so so a couple of so a a firm firm shouldn shouldn  t be be at any advantage or disadvantage disadvantage because because of of when when it a race race  final component component is to in in the the past past as pollsterinduced error error  residual error error component can  t be sampling error temporal error grown to the term term  pollsterinduced error error  accusatory than than it it should should  projecting turnout turnout  hard and and it it may may not be the the pollster pollster  s fault fault when when it our research on election election day temporal error error  and took took an sample size size  sampling error the average average one final margin the race race by however  some polling associated with with more more of of this this type type of of error our plusminus to evaluate step 4  calculate plusminus earlier earlier this year  house majority majority leader eric cantor cantor lost primary to to david david brat brat  a college college professor professor  in virginia virginia  congressional district district  it was was a at least for instance instance  a vox vox populi populi poll put cantor cantor ahead ahead by by 12 points  the vox vox populi populi poll by 24 points  simple plusminus plusminus  that poll poll would we don don  comprehensive database database of them in in the the pollster but i d guess off by like 10 on average average  vox populi populi  s poll by 24 so it it would simple plusminus plusminus score score of terrible  you compare compare it to the poll of the race internal poll by mclaughlin mclaughlin  on behalf behalf of of cantor cantor  s campaign campaign  that poll had cantor cantor up by 34 points  a 46point error  if we relative plusminus plusminus  the poll the same same race the vox vox populi populi poll poll would get a  since since it it was points more more accurate the mclaughlin mclaughlin survey survey  plusminus  next step the calculation calculation  seeks to to balance the number polling firms20 the same same race race  simple plusminus plusminus as as equivalent equivalent to for example example  if six six other certain race race  relative plusminus plusminus would would get the weight weight and simple plusminus plusminus would the short short version version  there are are a a lot lot of the field field  plusminus is based on on how how well a poll poll did did in in comparison comparison to the same same election election   but but when there is is scant comparison to the same same type type of of election election  for example example  might wonder about another another problem problem  if we comparing a a poll poll against shouldn  t we we account the strength the competition competition  if a a pollster every election election by points  to look look good good by by comparison comparison if if you happen to to poll poll the the same the problem problem is similar to to the the one one you encounter if if you you try try to to design design college college football you  ll want want to to account for strength strength of of schedule in addition addition to victory  of iteration iteration  good explanation a technique ratings  problem  as i to be be more more accurate accurate when there are them in in the the field this may may reflect  selection selection bias bias  may be be more to survey survey easier consider how how many them are challenging senate kansas and and alaska alaska this some combination combination thereof thereof  advancedplus minus minus also based on on how how many the same same election effect of do and swoop in already a a dozen the field field  weight on recent polls21 polls21 it it also subtle adjustment adjustment to to account the higher higher volatility volatility of certain election presidential primaries22 primaries22 before before we final step let  s pause pause to to reexamine reexamine the the 28  but but this this time plusminus rather rather than simple average average error error  there  s still a correlation correlation  although it somewhat weaker weaker than the correlation correlation coefficient coefficient is instead of of 060 the fact american research research group a lot lot of the firm firm look bad  for instance instance  but pollster pollster performance performance still to be predictable to some extent extent  as i ll describe describe next next  predictable if if you at a a poll in addition addition to past performance performance  step 5 predictive plusminus plusminus when the pollster failed to to be be explicit our goal goal  to predict predict which be most most accurate forward  this is to know know if if you forecast election for example example   but may not purpose  if you you  in a retrospective analysis analysis of of poll poll accuracy accuracy  there are in our our pollster for instance instance  you  ll find find each each pollster pollster  simple plusminus plusminus and the version version i recommend is called  plusminus  retrospective but small number the database23 database23 the the difference difference with predictive plusminus plusminus is it also polling firm albeit in in a roundabout way way  in 2010 looked at polling firm firm was a member member of national council or a a supporter american association public opinion opinion research research  aapor   transparency initiative24 one one other thing i i was clear enough enough about about in in 2010 that participation participation in intended as as a a proxy methodological quality quality  a correlate correlate of methodological quality than a direct measure measure of of it25 it25 nevertheless in one one of tended to to have have more more accurate have they they also been more more accurate accurate since yes they the chart chart below the performance performance of the aapor aapor transparency initiative as as of of june june 6 released a a full full set set of of pollster pollster ratings26 ratings26 from through 2009 the average average poll poll from from an polling firm an error error of an average average error did not not participate participate in in one this difference difference is significant  it isn isn  impressive  the reason reason is evaluated participation participation in in aaporncpp the fact fact  terrible track survive long to participate participate in in aaporncpp aaporncpp as as of of june june 2010 didn  t admit them  impressive is the difference difference has to be be just just as substantial since since june june 2010 general election participated in in aaporncpp aaporncpp as as of that june associated with with an an average average error with 57 hadn   and including both general election the aaporncpp associated with with an an average average error versus 52 for clarity clarity  the 2010 and 2012 results are true outofsample the chart the polling based on in june june 2010 in my my view this is persuasive evidence least to to the the extent can infer something about about it it from aaporncpp participation participation  year  methodological quality test is similar to to before before  is a polling firm firm a of ncpp ncpp  participant in in the the aapor aapor transparency initiative  it release the roper roper center archive  and second second  the firm in addition addition to methodological score between 0 and 2 based on on the tracking which ve done done a extensive search through recent whether they they document we do do not list a polling firm firm as some evidence we encourage contact us with documentation calling cellphones28 cellphones28 so so let let  say you have one polling firm hasn  been so so accurate accurate  t meet standards but good track track record record  which one expect to to be be more more accurate forward  the question predictive plusminus ratings are to address address  isn  t straightforward straightforward  a sample sample of from each each firm finding is past performance more noise signal until to evaluate evaluate  so you go with with the the firm that point point  if you from each each pollster pollster  however  to value value past past performance performance over methodology29 one further complication complication is herding  inferior pollster pollster may may be to match match those the stronger left to might not do so so well my colleague colleague harry at senate polls since their accuracy there are are also the field own research research on the broader polling database database did did not so large large an instead it it was was closer closer to the effect effect was significant  as a a result predictive plusminus herding penalty penalty  low methodology the formula formula for for how to calculate predictive plusminus plusminus is in the the footnotes31 a version version of reverted toward toward a mean  the poll passed one one or methodological standards32 standards32 the the fewer a firm firm has has  the more score is mean  predictive plusminus plusminus is a poll poll  a few the database database  its past those with with many33 many33 as final step step  translated each each firm predictive plusminus rating into into a a letter grade   from from a a to to f f one purpose of of this this is to make vast majority majority of in the middle of of the the spectrum spectrum  percent of the b b or c range range  there are whole bunch bunch of of other the pollster bias and and house the pollster valuable tool tool  so we to make make sure sure you a few few more for how how to
