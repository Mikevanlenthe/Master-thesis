methodology and had more more accurate the second second standard standard is whether the the firm placing telephone which are hybrid or or mixedmode for example example  supplementing with with cellphone essential to to call about half home landline landline  although internet promise as alternative  consistent enough enough track track record record to to be the same pedestal as as highquality highquality  liveinterview telephone our view the evidence evidence  enough about about methodology let  s return the question question of in the the 2014 midterms and and 2016 first  a calculation calculation we we call simple average average error error  the difference difference between between the the percentage the vote top two the election shown by by the for instance instance  if a a poll projected trump trump to to beat cruz by an election election and and trump by 10 points  would count count as as an percentage point point error  likewise likewise  it would would count count as if trump projected to to beat beat cruz cruz by points but but lost lost to to him him by instead  in 2014 the average gubernatorial poll an error error of this way way  the average average senate senate poll an error error of a bit bit more more accurate usual and and the the senate a bit bit less less  in line line with a bigger bigger problem problem is missed in in the the same same direction direction  republican candidate that point point up a moment moment  polls are less accurate accurate than than senate senate or further down down the the ballot ballot you the larger larger the polling error to be was no no exception exception  with the the average average house house poll by 79 that  s not good result result by by any any stretch the imagination imagination  by a a single polling firm firm  yougov  most of of those small sample fewer than respondents   and and most of them can be be difficult difficult to to poll  our plusminus and predictive plusminus simple average average error yougov  the average average error error for for house still a a mediocre mediocre performance performance  similar to to past as 1998 and 2010 if house can be tricky to to poll harder  for some some of i mention turnout is low  people are several similar  and wait until the last last minute primary polling polling is is almost ride  the average average error year was was a worse than than the the average primaries since worse on democratic side side  with an an average average error with 83 republican race race  have done done a good job job of percent of year  candidate in in the the poll winning candidate candidate in the election election  much better better than than in in 2012  when when the percent of of the the time time  gives  a lot lot of year  regional voting the south south  and trump in the the northeast northeast  for example example  by contrast contrast  a lot down to to the the wire wire in in 2012 easier to to call call the course  an election election isn isn  competitive  the other other hand hand  can be be harder harder for the margin margin in noncompetitive race can discourage discourage turnout turnout  the score score or trailing candidate candidate to to do much better better than because the candidate  complacent  technical matter handling of noncompetitive races3 races3 in in a slight change change this advanced plusminus plusminus and predictive plusminus ratings account the fact races are with a a larger larger error on average average  this doesn doesn  measure of polling performance statistical bias bias  miss in in the the same same direction direction  if over a large large number for example polling firm win by by an an average and they win by by 2 prodemocratic   and statistical bias bias of statistical bias bias isn an indication indication of partisan bias prorepublican bias their coverage statistical bias in their and vice vice versa versa  but it it has has nevertheless been a a problem problem in in recent  the percentage point prorepublican bias bias  that they president obama gubernatorial and by contrast contrast  percentage point prodemocratic bias bias  so rather republican year by the in the the good over the long run run  of an an overall but the the bias bias has shifted around from election election to to election election  wary of that the bound to to be biased in in the the same same direction that they statistical bias to agree with one one another strong consensus consensus among among the herding  of line line with with the the consensus consensus  good election can account the possibility possibility of herding and statistical bias bias by the error error in correlated from from state state to to state state  but it degree of of difficulty difficulty in a model model  bias in in the shown in in the table above because the the bias our pollster can calculate calculate them the same same method method  statistical bias bias has has been been a a problem problem in both party a protrump protrump and and anticruz anticruz bias bias  trump and and cruz the top top two some order the bias bias was in trump trump  s favor the bias the race race went  and wasn  t as much of of a a bias another candidate candidate  john kasich marco rubio rubio  was trump trump  s main main competitor competitor in in a a state state  to raise the
