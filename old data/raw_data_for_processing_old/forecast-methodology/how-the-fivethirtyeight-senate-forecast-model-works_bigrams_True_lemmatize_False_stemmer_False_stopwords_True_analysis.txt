2016 the same by the the same the fivethirtyeight fivethirtyeight senate senate forecast forecast model this month month  about a a 53 percent chance chance of picking up the senate senate next year  we owe owe you you a a lot more detail detail about forecast is calculated and and how how it might change change between and how how our our model some of of the this article article  the model model  s methodology methodology  to be be on on the side  to keep keep the plain language language as possible  technical  but it s meant meant to to be be a comprehensive reference reference guide guide rather rather than than breezy breezy bedtime reading  first  however  i want want to describe the the model model  some of these are philosophical and and abstract of as can get get passionate this stuff stuff   but contrary to to the the media media portrayal portrayal of of election our goal goal is is not to divine divine some magic formula every election election  instead  sense of of publicly available information information in rigorous and principle 1 a good good model probabilistic  deterministic1 the the fivethirtyeight fivethirtyeight model the same same sense sense a forecaster might might tell tell you a 20 percent chance chance of of rain rain tomorrow the fivethirtyeight fivethirtyeight model model might might estimate estimate the the democrat democrat has has a percent chance chance of the senate senate race race in kentucky  my view that this this is important part part of hardest part part  the most the democrat democrat will the race race by immune to in methodology methodology  can be be very sensitive to to them them  lead translate translate into into a percent chance chance of a 95 percent chance chance  can be tricky   quickanddirty the margin margin of of error in a a poll poll is is a complete reflection reflection of its accuracy hold up up well the real real world our database database of conducted in final three three weeks weeks of campaigns since since 1998 the poll poll  reported margin margin of percent of of the the time3 time3 so so it important to to model model the the error based on on how have done done in in past instead of fact  seen as bold when media coverage coverage of campaigns4 they with some some other for a a variety variety of toward overconfidence overconfidence unless they  test of of a probabilistic forecast forecast is is whether whether it s well calibrated  mean  of all all fivethirtyeight a 75 shot of do the fact win percent of of the the time over the long run run  a problem problem if percent of of the the time time   but statistical standpoint standpoint  s just just as much of of a a problem problem if if they percent of of the the time time  fivethirtyeight  s senate been well calibrated  the data data on on github github so check them for yourself yourself  for example example  of the the 12 a candidate candidate between between an percent and and a percent chance chance of on election election day favored candidate in 11 cases  or 92 percent of of the the time7 time7 we we also a track track record record of being well calibrated in in other of election principle 2 a good good model empirical   simplicity can be be a a virtue virtue in but every every model model must must be consistent with with the the evidence s one your model model  but if if you don  t account for a a certain variable or statistical property property in your model model  implicit assumption it doesn doesn  t matter much  for instance instance  wrong to to treat registered voter same as historical evidence registered voter to overrate overrate the mentioned  s almost wrong to the error error in in a a poll poll is of error error  s also to assume the error error in in one one poll poll is is independent next  miss in in the the same same direction direction  can lead lead to toward one the other other party party  s also important to to check check whether sound basis basis in in theory theory   one variable our our model an ideology ideology score for each each candidate candidate  to estimate estimate how liberal or conservative he he or or she relative to his or state  variable is significant in predicting election but just just as important is it has has a strong basis basis in political science science literature this case case  median voter voter theorem theorem  by contrast contrast  if we d found past election the number a candidate had in in her her middle middle name suspect this this was statistical fluke fluke and and we we wouldn t include include it our model model  principle 3 a good good model to respond gyrate around slightest provocation provocation should should be importantseeming information information  the fivethirtyeight fivethirtyeight senate senate model can make dull from from day day to to day of the the time time  the new effect on on the the bottom bottom line line   but almost all all the particular day day favor favor one the other other party party  the overall overall forecast for senate senate control few percentage party  s direction direction  there will more volatility in the the forecast forecast toward toward the the end the campaign campaign because because late can  t be before election election day day  sports analogy an nfl nfl team field goal goal with with two to play play in in the first quarter favorite to to win8 win8 but but one so with with two to play play in the fourth fourth quarter a 2point shift in in the can produce produce a a larger larger change change in in win an election election  principle 4 a good good model to avoid in midstream midstream  guilty of fivethirtyeight model model as though it it has has a it doesn doesn  s just just a a computer computer program program  the program program  however we we don don  the forecast forecast in in a state just just because because we we don don  the outcome outcome  changing the the program program once once we the forecasts9 forecasts9 nor do we we change change it much from year to year  the senate senate model model is percent to to 90 percent the the same same as as when when we it in in 2008  and and is is also presidential forecast forecast model model  along with probabilistic rather rather than deterministic  speaking of that model model  it do there are step 1 polling average we start start by discard  first are that we know or suspect to to have engaged in in other ethical misconduct misconduct  for instance instance  strategic vision vision and and research on behalf behalf of senatorial campaign campaign committee national committee committee  tend to to be be inaccurate inaccurate and and biased11 biased11 we we err the side side of of inclusiveness the threshold threshold for a poll poll is high12 the the model model has has a a lot other defense defense mechanisms minimizing the the effect effect of that show through our our   house adjustment  in step step 2 for more more about our philosophy philosophy on on this this  this discussion discussion  a poll poll is based on it was  older exponential decay decay formula the penalty more emphasis emphasis is on recency the closer closer we we get get to to the the election13 our research much emphasis emphasis on on recency recency and better off a broader broader range range of the poll poll  s sample sample more receive a a larger particular  ve found the improvement improvement in in accuracy sampling more as large in practice practice as as it to be be in this are ll discuss discuss

fivethirtyeight fivethirtyeight model this by calculating a buffer zone zone  based on number of a firm firm has released  for instance instance  a firm firm with buffer zone zone of any house effect beyond buffer zone zone is the poll poll  so a polling firm firm with with a a 5point republican house house effect effect and buffer zone zone will new feature the model model this year is past years29 years29 are to help calibrate the the house their influence influence is minor31 house fairly consistent consistent from from election to election election   but for instance instance  the firm firm rasmussen reports  republican house house effect effect the the past past  has little little house house effect effect so year  the main main case this is helpful is is when when a a firm firm with with a long history history of to poll poll a a few having been been dormant the cycle cycle  another question question is is how to calculate calculate the the baseline that other compared against against  weighted average average  where the the weight weight is based on a firm firm has released and rating   this the baseline baseline is the stronger saying32 in in 2012  this benefit  tended to to show show stronger them  such consistent consistent pattern pattern this year  the trend trend line line adjustment adjustment is is an important part part of of the presidential model model  important in in the the senate senate model model  presidential race race  can make make accurate changing in in one one state based on on how how they changing in in other for instance instance  if barack barack obama relative to to mitt mitt romney romney in michigan and and minnesota minnesota  be almost almost certain d also ground in in wisconsin if wisconsin wisconsin hadn hadn  t been in senate are different the ballot in each each state much weaker weaker  instead  the fivethirtyeight line adjustment adjustment is based on congressional ballot looking for congressional ballot ballot as by the the same the same for instance instance  polls of and then time trend trend by a lowess smoothing regression regression  for more more detail detail  the trend trend line line adjustment republican movement movement on generic ballot ballot  the adjustment adjustment is in the the senate senate model33 model33 it polling average in each each state state toward by an an average let  s interrupt draw some some probability there are are big those senate that look look at but it s more complicated than in recent running our our model based on on the polling average average alone alone  after step step 2 the gop gop  controlling the the senate senate by percent  it doesn huge difference difference  complete story story   small senate race race are close  most election work in something like like the first  calculate the the most outcome in in a particular state degree of of uncertainty this by normal distribution distribution or similar to to it in this this type type of statistical distribution distribution   all the margin margin of of error error are instead  those closer closer to mean of the distribution distribution are probable  graphic below below  for example example  normal distribution distribution with mean of of 1 as in a candidate candidate is ahead by point in in the standard deviation deviation of this example mean the the race race and mean the the democrat according to to the normal distribution republican will percent of of the the time time  we shift shift the the center the distribution distribution by by just just 1 point toward toward the republican  our model than someone else  and it to win win by instead of of 1 it has has a effect on on the huge  noticeable  s gone gone from being a favorite to to a favorite  by contrast contrast  if we republican an additional point point when when she ahead  it wouldn t make much difference difference  if she by 10 points in in the for instance instance  already be be a according to to the normal distribution distribution  by 11 points instead instead would that chance chance to percent   however however  can affect affect the the candidate candidate  win probability probability  the standard standard deviation the example below  republican  s lead but i the standard standard deviation deviation to instead of mere 2point lead she she  favorite to to win win  in my my view view  little attention attention is is paid paid to the uncertainty the forecast forecast  to the the most result  i don don  like to to call call out out other i have them  and we we think think most most of the other pretty great great  but one one is is in in so perceived disagreement disagreement with some attention attention  s the the model by sam sam wang wang  an associate associate professor professor of molecular biology at princeton princeton  model is wrong  republican advantage advantage  but because because it the uncertainty associated with with polling the win this is is because because instead instead of the uncertainty looking at at how how accurate been in in the the past past  about how that don don  t check check out the data34 rich record record of failing and resulting in highly overconfident for example example  wang  s model made sharron sharron angle favorite in in nevada nevada against harry reid reid  estimated she she was ahead in in the but with with a standard error error of just 05 points  if we based on on wang above35 it it would have angle the race percent of of the the time time  reid  s victory victory was a 30000to1 shot  to be clear  the fivethirtyeight fivethirtyeight model had angle also  but it much more more uncertainty reid  s win win came came as as a in our our model model instead instead of in wang wang  those are are very very different a number like this this  republican gain gain of seats in in the the house house in in 2010  but but with with a a margin margin of of error error of just plus plus or minus two his forecast odds against picking up at least least 63 seats  as they did  want a  model the uncertainty the huffington huffington post post  s or linzer  to get the way proceeding to to the the state calculation  is one complicated and controversial  the fivethirtyeight fivethirtyeight model model  much influence influence on the forecast step 3 calculate state can take take advantage the fact the same same two on the the ballot in each each state state  to make one state the next37 isn  t true for senate the state guide  final margin the race race by by an an average average of like 9 why bother bother at at all one reason reason is alternative  occasional senate senate race polling  polling38 in alaska and and kansas year  little idea idea of going on it helps helps to backstop  republicanleaning  another reason reason to to look look beyond to prevent the forecast forecast  for instance instance  the recent recent strong kentucky or in line line with fundamentals calculation any event event  the state on a predictive power power in in senate relative importance importance is by regression regression analysis congressional ballot an indication indication of partisan mood mood in the country country  writing  the fivethirtyeight fivethirtyeight model generic ballot congressional approval approval ratings40 ratings40 this national indicator indicator  it doesn doesn  t work the benefit benefit of party  instead  the model model about the overall overall amount amount of antipathy toward their party party  congressional approval their historic some of of the the incumbency incumbency advantage41 data is useful indicator a number can reflect reflect the for a a candidate candidate  or a a candidate candidate  s overall overall level of organization organization  and money can be goods and turnout operation our model variable as as the the proportion proportion of by each each majorparty majorparty candidate candidate  for instance instance  if the the democrat democrat has million and the democrat democrat has percent of of the the money money  this definition the diminishing additional fundraising42 fundraising42 the the fivethirtyeight fivethirtyeight model at the the sum through pacs pacs or super pacs pacs  by the year  is one optimistic  they  our definition definition in in almost almost all the most important senate elected office this is the less important variables43 variables43 but but it some influence influence  we rate a 4point based on on the the highest highest office office they ve been for current current or or former by definition including all incumbent senators44 the house house of elected office office  general and of large large cities45 cities45  point for such as as state state senator senator or representative  have never substantive position46 position46 margin of victory victory in in most most recent recent senate senate election past victory victory margin margin is is not not a reliable indicator indicator  political mood can shift shift a a lot lot in in six but it  victory relative to national climate48 climate48 in the reelection year  hurts this s crop crop of  since since most of them elected in in 2008 a highwater highwater mark the party party  for instance instance  sen kay kay hagan carolina won her race race by by an impressive 85 elizabeth dole dole in in 2008  but came in in an an environment environment when popular vote the us house by by 106 her election election in political environment environment  did not not face majorparty opposition their last last reelection reelection bid bid  such as as mark mark pryor pryor of of arkansas arkansas  won reelection reelection by candidate ideology ideology and and state state partisanship partisanship  can think as one one  the fivethirtyeight fivethirtyeight model conservativeliberal ideology ideology of of a a candidate candidate and and then against the estimated ideology ideology of the state the larger larger the the difference between them them  the worse worse the the candidate candidate is to perform perform  the candidate candidate ideology based on on an three systems49 systems49 which which are more length here   dwnominate a candidate candidate  voting record record in in congress congress  created by by adam adam bonica bonica of of stanford stanford university which estimate leftright ideology the identity identity of of a a candidate candidate  made by by the the candidate candidate on on a of policy ranging from gay marriage marriage to to tax tax policy50 policy50 the the score score from from each each system that each the same same average standard deviation deviation  for a a direct direct comparison them  we in in turn the ideology ideology of in each each state on two national average recent past the state state  the average average dwnominate dwnominate score the state congressional delegation the past past four four congresses51 congresses51 this to account account for for example example  vote very for president president but congress  can make make some some difference difference  in a purple state in line line with national average average   mainstream mainstream  republican52 would would be to perform perform a a net net of conservative  tea party party republican53 republican53 this variable  for instance instance  to predict predict sen sen claire claire mccaskill republican todd todd akin akin in in missouri missouri in in 2012 however  year are moderate  among the the more important senate the state alaska  kentucky  minnesota and and north carolina  them in in arkansas arkansas  georgia and and iowa iowa  important effect effect is is in in kansas kansas  where a independent candidate candidate  greg orman orman  republican incumbent incumbent  roberts   but fundamentals calculation calculation has heavy favorite favorite  polling average average and and the fundamentals calculation some tendency tendency to to converge converge toward toward one has already such as michigan54 step step 4 part is simple  polling average step 2 and the the state step 3  are into a a single happen in in an an election referred to to this the  nowcast  snapshot  the state as equivalent equivalent to to a poll  with a our poll weights are poll from from a a firm firm with an average average pollster weight of on the the day this weight weight will decline as as the the poll weight as low as as 035 so the the state treated as as tantamount tantamount to to a a single single bad bad  though recent recent  poll   this presidential model model  where the the state reliable and weight  abundant recent polling  the state fundamentals calculation no difference difference  writing  for instance percent of of the the overall kentucky and percent in in iowa iowa  however  it has has more more influence influence on with less polling  the state percent of of the the weight weight in in alaska alaska  for example example  percent in in delaware the election the state to get get less less and and less less weight because the the volume increases56 step  election election day fivethirtyeight model model is meant to to be be a a forecast forecast of the election election will nov 4 rather than than an an estimate estimate of happen in an election the future in the the forecast forecast  ll discuss in step in addition the model model might might anticipate overall shift shift toward toward one one party party or although this this has minor influence influence on the forecast forecast at at this this point the race presidential model model  we calculate calculate a a projection popular vote economic index this estimate estimate also the benefit benefit of might think this as as an an estimate the state that obama popular vote vote by percentage points59 points59 whenever whenever obama lead of than 2 such as as after democratic convention convention  this calculation something from from his his lead the election election day day result result  s lead lead fell below 2 points  such after after the presidential debate debate in in denver denver  something to to it the model obama  s result result would revert toward toward the mean of of how how past performed under the model model was the weight the course course of the campaign campaign  until it it was was zero zero by by election election day shown obama obama with with an an 11point by election election day or romney romney with with a a 9point lead  the model such a a result result would been inconsistent inconsistent with with how the past past  similar step our senate senate model model this year in in order consistent with presidential model model  the senate senate version a bit bit simpler simpler and and has has less less overall overall influence influence on the forecast forecast  the model congressional ballot ballot will revert toward toward a mean of the opposition opposition party party  this case case  of election election day day  the ballot ballot  historic average average performance not account presidential approval the favorability other factor as in in the presidential model model  the weight historic average the election election year small  and it it will be zero zero by by election election day  position position on generic ballot to show show a a deficit deficit with much different the longterm longterm average61 each state state than than they would otherwise62 otherwise62 it would make make more more difference difference earlier the election generic ballot of line line with step 6 estimate margin margin of of error error if if you gotten this this far far  you  i think this step step is important  as i the goal goal of of the the fivethirtyeight fivethirtyeight model model is is not call  instead to to estimate estimate the the probability that each each candidate candidate will and some associated with more uncertainty this is by our interactive senate senate forecast the picture picture below looked as as of the chart chart represent represent the the most the gray the uncertainty uncertainty  the 90 percent prediction prediction interval interval  in colorado colorado  for instance instance  while the the most outcome is is a a win democratic candidate candidate by the prediction prediction interval the way a 12point democratic win win to republican  wide range range  remember  percent of of the percent chance the democrat democrat will win by by more more than points and and a percent chance republican will win by than 6 however  the prediction prediction interval interval is even wider kansas  alaska and and louisiana louisiana  how are ve done done it it by looking at correlated with with larger the forecast63 forecast63  and we these ought ought to to be intuitive  is larger larger the the when there are are more go until the election64 election64 this the model model will confident as as election election day uncertainty is is larger larger when there are are fewer year  s election election has the recent recent past past  also lowerquality lowerquality polls65 polls65  the uncertainty than it it was was in in 2008  2010 or 2012 the uncertainty uncertainty is a statebystate statebystate basis basis  like georgia georgia are less uncertainty like alaska is larger with one one another take one one state the democrat democrat ahead ahead by points and and another the democrat democrat is republican in in one one poll poll but ahead in in another the democrat democrat has has a a 5point lead in in the polling average in both  but more uncertainty ve found the state disagree with with one uncertainty is is larger when the the polling polling average with the the state another reason reason for the   state estimate  much weight weight you you place place on on it is to to get get a a sense sense for for whether whether it consistent story story with with the is more more divergence divergence between in kansas kansas this year  the uncertainty uncertainty is much higher higher  is larger larger when there are this is intuitive assumption in the the data data  a lot of senate year feature high uncertainty viable thirdparty with very high volatility volatility  is larger the race race is is more this is is the the one isn  t the the outcome in doubt doubt when when the close race race  of course course it it is if you you  concerned about about who but as the difference difference between between the polled and and the actual margin the race race  the error to be be larger larger when there is is a a bigger bigger gap common  for instance instance  for a a candidate candidate up by 40 points in in the her race race by points or or 50 points instead step 7 the probability probability of each party the senate senate once once we completed step step 6 mean  republican is is ahead ahead by points  standard deviation deviation  or minus points  the forecast forecast in in each each state state  as i mentioned   you can use normal distribution distribution to to calculate calculate a a candidate candidate  win probability these two so why why not just stop one minor minor reason reason is because the the fivethirtyeight fivethirtyeight model normal distribution distribution  instead it a transformation normal distribution distribution with the transformation might mean mean  for example example  that we we would a candidate candidate with with a percent chance chance to his race race instead instead of percent chance chance  this process process is is not complicated and little difference difference  instead  we run deal with with a couple of of more  one one is the error independent from from state state to to state state  a number one party party has has either considerable ground the closing the race race  or the had a bias toward toward one one party party or on election election day in 1994  1998 and 2012 this property property is is not the same same two on the the ballot in each each state state  but it enough to to worry as i in step the model the overall overall amount of error each state based on the election the volume volume of there  number of the model the error national error error and and statespecific same way way  statespecific error error  one state state at at a a time time  in each each simulation the program first number national error error  in one one simulation simulation  for instance instance  the draw draw might might be every state state in that simulation simulation  another number in each each state state  perhaps in in arkansas arkansas  for instance instance  with  to produce produce a simulated result result in in each each state state  in arkansas this example example  mean the the democrat democrat  mark pryor pryor  his projection projection by poor night if pryor his opponent opponent by fewer than points  by any any margin margin  would be enough to to win the race race in that simulation simulation  if he been behind behind more more than points  d still come up short70 in in this this way can estimate estimate not candidate  s chance chance of winning but number of each party party will will control control  the possibility that it it could could be be a like 1994 or 2012 when almost almost all the same same direction the simulation simulation is is also helpful for viable thirdparty such as larry pressler pressler of of south south dakota71 dakota71 who couple of one is the range range of symmetric  a thirdparty thirdparty candidate at 15 percent with with some some time time to to go the race some chance chance  a lot lot  points and at 35 percent  which case case he he could as i  vote can be be volatile72 volatile72  but he he has has no no chance chance of points and at 5 percent73 so so we we model the vote on a lognormal distribution distribution  this type type of of asymmetry asymmetry  to one the majorparty  trade trade  gubernatorial election election in in 2010 for example the independent independent  eliot cutler cutler  was left left of of center center and much closer closer to to the the democrat democrat  libby mitchell mitchell  republican candidate candidate  paul lepage lepage  when cutler began to to gain gain ground ground late the race race  almost all all of of his taken from from mitchell from lepage the model this by the ideology in step in south south dakota dakota  for example example  pressler  s vote vote share pressler is is a republican  correlated with with the republican  the democrat democrat  rick weiland weiland  so in likewise  when pressler back most most of of his the very very last last step counting up number of in each each simulation simulation  them to to the the baseline baseline of not up for grabs grabs this the model to one one of on how how we we do greg orman orman of of kansas kansas has ll caucus caucus with whichever party the majority majority  a kink our probability probability distribution distribution   but orman  s ideology ideology score score  percent probability probability of caucusing with the event event his his vote would determine determine majority majority control control  thousands76 of the likelihood likelihood of with a number of produces a a probability probability distribution like this this  ties are democratic control control because tiebreaking vote vote of of vice vice president president joe joe biden biden  so we we count the percentage percentage of with at at least seats  represents their retaining the the senate any other
