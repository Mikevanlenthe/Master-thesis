some of, these are, philosophical and, and abstract, they describe, of as, can get, get passionate, this stuff, stuff but, contrary to, to the, the media, media portrayal, portrayal of, of election, our goal, goal is, is not, to divine, divine some, magic formula, every election, election instead, instead it, it s, to make, make sense, sense of, of publicly, available information, information in,

of, the senate, senate race, race in, kentucky my, my view, that this, this is, important part, part of, modeling and, hardest part, the most, the democrat, democrat will, the race, race by, in methodology, methodology but, can be, be very, sensitive to, to them, lead translate, translate into, into a, percent chance, chance of, a 95, percent chance, chance or, can be, tricky quickanddirty, the margin, margin of, of error, in a, a poll, poll is, is a, complete reflection, reflection of, its accuracy, hold up, up well, the real, real world, our database, database of, conducted in, final three, three weeks, weeks of, campaigns since, since 1998, the poll, poll s, reported margin, margin of, percent of, of the, the time3, time3 so, so it, it s, important to, to model, model the, the

speaking of, that model, model what, it do, polling average, we start, start by, a few, first are, those from, that we, know or, suspect to, to have, engaged in, in other, ethical misconduct, for instance, strategic vision, vision and, and research, on behalf, behalf of, senatorial campaign, campaign committee, national committee, to be, be inaccurate, inaccurate and, and biased11, biased11 we, we err, the side, side of, the threshold, threshold for, a poll, poll is, high12 the, the model, model has, has a, a lot, other defense, minimizing the, the effect, effect of, that show, through our, our house, which i, i ll, ll describe, in step, for more, more about, our philosophy, philosophy on, this see, this discussion, discussion a, a poll, poll is, based on, it was, conducted older, exponential decay, decay formula, formula the, the penalty, is more, more emphasis, emphasis is, on recency, the closer, closer we, we get, get to, to the, the election13, our research, much emphasis,

the, the pollster, we ve, released an, of pollster, and explain, explain the, the process, calculating them, them in, much more, more depth, depth in, in a, a separate, separate article, article the, the method, method is, similar to, to one, one we, in 2010, however in, in that, rated on, the basis, basis of, their past, past accuracy16, accuracy16 and, and on, methodological quality, is whether, whether the, polling firm, firm is, a member, member of, of industry, the aapor, aapor transparency, transparency initiative17, and second, second is, whether the, the firm, in addition, addition to, don t, t tell, you need, about a, a poll, poll but, to be, correlated with, with other, going forward, forward truth, truth be, the poll, a huge, huge impact, this year, an exception, the main, main way, way to, to go, wrong is, placing too, much emphasis, the most, most recent, can lead, lead to, volatility a, a few, housekeeping on, come up, from time, time to, to time, the same, don t, t throw, the old, old poll, poll but, weight see, for how, works if, if a, a pollster, voter and, registered voter, voter version19, version19 in, in other, the pollster, the same, same poll, for instance, two different, different turnout, a minor, minor candidate, candidate included20, included20 we, we simply, simply average, average all, based on, of new, each edition, poll21 step, to the, the polling, polling average, average the, the fivethirtyeight, fivethirtyeight model, voter adjustment, adjustment a, a house, adjustment and, the least, important of, three a, line adjustment, adjustment the, the rationale, for the, adjustment is, some length, polls of, favorable to, of broader, to be, be more, more accurate, accurate and, and less, as a, a default, default the, the fivethirtyeight, fivethirtyeight model, registered voter, comparable to, particular the, the model, by 27, historical average, average difference, difference between, voter and, registered voter, magnitude of, of the, the shift, shift is, based on, like this, this one, registered voter, voter and, the same, same survey22, survey22 so, the average23, average23 gap, gap has, has been, been just, just above, points the, the house, the tendency, some polling, for one, one or, the other, other party24, party24 it, a regression, regression analysis, all senate, senate and, congressional ballot, polls25 this, this is, is one, one of, comparing a, a poll, poll against, the same, same state26, state26 however, however one, one or, or two, two or, may not, much about, about a, a pollster, pollster s, s house, effect variation, just be, statistical noise, noise instead, instead furthermore, a model, model without, some tolerance, tolerance for, of opinion, deprive itself, itself of, of the, first place, place the, the fivethirtyeight, fivethirtyeight model, this by, calculating a, buffer zone, zone 27, based on, number of, a firm, firm has, for instance, instance a, a firm, firm with, buffer zone, zone of, effect beyond, buffer zone, zone is, the poll, poll so, so a, polling firm, firm with, with a, a 5point, republican house, house effect, effect and, buffer zone, zone will, new feature, the model, model this, year is, past years29, years29 are, to help, calibrate the, the house, their influence, influence is, minor31 house, fairly consistent, consistent from, from election, to election, election but, for instance, instance the, the firm, firm rasmussen, had a, republican house, house effect, effect the, the past, has little, little house, house effect, effect so, year the, the main, main case, this is, helpful is, is when, when a, a firm, firm with, with a, long history, history of, to poll, poll a, a few, having been, been dormant, the cycle, cycle another, another question, question is, is how, to calculate, calculate the, the baseline, that other, compared against, against we, weighted average, the weight, weight is, based on, a firm, firm has, released and, rating this, the baseline, baseline is, the stronger, saying32 in, in 2012, worked to, benefit the, tended to, to show, show stronger, them but, but we, we ve, such consistent, consistent pattern, pattern this, the trend, trend line, line adjustment, adjustment is, is an, important part, part of, of the, presidential model, model but, but not, important in, in the, the senate, senate model, model in, presidential race, race you, can make, make accurate, changing in, in one, one state, based on, on how, how they, changing in, in other, for instance, instance if, if barack, barack obama, relative to, to mitt, mitt romney, romney in, michigan and, and minnesota, minnesota you, be almost, almost certain, he d, d also, ground in, in wisconsin, if wisconsin, wisconsin hadn, hadn t, t been, in senate, the ballot, in each, each state, much weaker, fivethirtyeight trend, trend line, line adjustment, adjustment is, based on, congressional ballot, looking for, congressional ballot, ballot as, by the, the same, the same, for instance, instance quinnipiac, backing out, out a, time trend, trend by, a lowess, smoothing regression, regression see, for more, more detail, detail the, the trend, trend line, line adjustment, republican movement, movement on, generic ballot, the adjustment, adjustment is, in the, the senate, senate model33, model33 it, polling average, in each, each state, state toward, by an, an average, s interrupt, draw some, some probability, there are, are big, those senate, that look, look at, it s, s more, complicated than, in recent, our model, based on, on the, polling average, average alone, alone after, after step, would reduce, reduce the, the gop, gop s, controlling the, the senate, senate by, percent it, it doesn, huge difference, s a, complete story, story small, senate race, race are, close most, most election, including ours, ours work, work in, something like, like the, first they, calculate the, the most, outcome in, in a, particular state, point and, and then, then they, determine the, the degree, degree of, of uncertainty, estimate most, this by, normal distribution, distribution or, similar to, to it, it in, in this, this type, type of, statistical distribution, distribution all, the margin, margin of, of error, error are, those closer, closer to, mean of, the distribution, distribution are, probable the, graphic below, below for, for example, normal distribution, distribution with, mean of, as in, in a, a candidate, candidate is, ahead by, point in, in the, standard deviation, deviation of, this example, example we, ll take, mean the, the race, race and, mean the, the democrat, normal distribution, distribution the, republican will, percent of, of the, the time, time but, but if, if we, we shift, shift the, the center, the distribution, distribution by, by just, just 1, point toward, toward the, our model, than someone, else s, s and, and it, to win, win by, instead of, has a, effect on, on the, huge but, she s, s gone, gone from, being a, favorite to, to a, favorite by, by contrast, contrast if, if we, republican an, additional point, point when, when she, ahead it, it wouldn, t make, much difference, difference if, if she, by 10, points in, in the, for instance, instance she, already be, be a, according to, to the, normal distribution, by 11, points instead, instead would, that chance, chance to, percent however, can affect, affect the, the candidate, candidate s, win probability, probability by, the standard, standard deviation, the example, below i, i ve, republican s, s lead, points but, but i, i ve, the standard, standard deviation, deviation to, instead of, now with, she s, favorite to, to win, win in, in my, my view, little attention, attention is, is paid, paid to, the uncertainty, the forecast, forecast as, to the, the most, result i, i don, don t, like to, to call, call out, out other, i have, them and, and we, think most, most of, the other, pretty great, great but, but one, one is, is in, in so, perceived disagreement, disagreement with, some attention, the model, by sam, sam wang, wang an, an associate, associate professor, professor of, molecular biology, at princeton, that model, model is, because it, republican advantage, advantage but, because it, the uncertainty, associated with, with polling, the win, this is, is

congresses51, congresses51 this, to account, account for, example arkansas, vote very, for president, president but, to congress, congress this, can make, make some, some difference, difference in, in a, purple state, in line, line with, national average, average a, a mainstream, mainstream republican52, republican52 would, would be, to perform, perform a, a net, net of, socalled tea, tea party,

are, important senate, kentucky louisiana, louisiana minnesota, minnesota and, carolina and, them in, in arkansas, arkansas georgia, georgia and, important effect, effect is, is in, in kansas, where a, independent candidate, candidate greg, greg orman, republican incumbent, incumbent pat, fundamentals calculation, calculation has, heavy favorite, favorite however, however the, polling average, average and, and the, fundamentals calculation, some tendency, tendency to, to converge, converge toward, toward one, has already, michigan54 step, this part, part is, pretty simple, simple the, polling average, average step, the state, estimate step, step 3, combined into, into a, single number, happen in, an election, we ve, referred to, to this, the nowcast, nowcast or, snapshot this, treating the, the state, as equivalent, equivalent to, to a, a poll, poll with, with a, weights are, poll from, from a, a firm, firm with, an average, average pollster, weight of, on the, the day, decline as, as the, the poll, weight as, low as, as 035, so the, the state, treated as, as tantamount, tantamount to, to a, a single, single bad, though recent, recent poll, poll this, presidential model, the state, reliable and, weight in, abundant recent, the state, fundamentals calculation, no difference, difference as, for instance, percent of, of the, the overall, kentucky and, percent in, in iowa, iowa however, however it, it has, has more, more influence, influence on, with less, the state, percent of, of the, the weight, weight in, in alaska, example and, percent in, in delaware, the election, the state, to get, get less, less and, and less, less weight, because the, the volume, increases56 step, fivethirtyeight model, model is, meant to, to be, be a, a forecast, forecast of, the election, election will, on nov, rather than, than an, an estimate, estimate of, happen in, an election, looking toward, toward the, the future, in the, the forecast, forecast we, we ll, ll discuss, in step, in addition, addition the, the model, model might, might anticipate, overall shift, shift toward, toward one, one party, party or, although this, this has, minor influence, influence on, the forecast, forecast at, at this, this point, the race, presidential model, model we, we calculate, calculate a, a projection, popular vote, economic index, index this, this estimate, estimate also, the benefit, benefit of, might think, this as, as an, an estimate, the state, that obama, popular vote, vote by, percentage points59, points59 whenever, whenever obama, lead of, than 2, as after, after the, democratic convention, convention this, this calculation, something from, from his, his lead, the election, election day, day result, s lead, lead fell, below 2, such after, after the,

the model, model was, the weight, the course, course of, the campaign, campaign until, until it, it was, was zero, zero by, by election, election day, shown obama, obama with, with an, an 11point, by election, election day, or romney, romney with, with a, a 9point, the model, such a, a result, result would, been inconsistent, inconsistent with, with how, the past, past we, we ve, similar step, our senate, senate model, model this, year in, in order, consistent with, presidential model, model however, however the, the senate, senate version, a bit, bit simpler, simpler and, and has, has less, less overall, overall influence, influence on, the forecast, the model, congressional ballot, ballot will, revert toward, toward a, mean of, the opposition, opposition party, party in, this case, of election, election day, the ballot, ballot s, historic average, average performance, not account, the favorability, other factor, as in, in the, presidential model, model however, however the, the weight, historic average, the election, election year, it s, small and, and it, it will, be zero, zero by, by election, election day, generic ballot, to show, show a, a deficit, deficit with, much different, the longterm, longterm average61, changes the, each state, state than, than they, would otherwise62, otherwise62 it, would make, make more, more difference, difference earlier, the election, generic ballot, of line, line with, estimate margin, margin of, of error, error if, if you, gotten this, this far, far you, you ll, i think, this step, step is, important as, as i, i ve, the goal, goal of, of the, the fivethirtyeight, fivethirtyeight model, model is, is not, to call, instead to, to estimate, estimate the, the probability, that each, each candidate, candidate will, win and, and some, associated with, more uncertainty, this is, by our, interactive senate, the picture, picture below, looked as, as of, the chart, chart represent, represent the, the most, the gray, the uncertainty, the 90, percent prediction, prediction interval, interval in, in colorado, for instance, instance while, while the, the most, outcome is, is a, a win, democratic candidate, candidate by, the prediction, prediction interval, the way, a 12point, democratic win, win to, wide range, range and, remember it, percent of, of the, also a, percent chance, the democrat, democrat will, win by, by more, more than, points and, and a, percent chance, republican will, win by, than 6, however the, the prediction, prediction interval, interval is, even wider, alaska and, and louisiana, louisiana how, how are, we ve, ve done, done it, it by, looking at, correlated with, with larger, the forecast63, forecast63 and, and we, we ve, these ought, ought to, to be, intuitive uncertainty, is larger, larger the, the when, there are, are more, go until, the election64, election64 this, the model, model will, confident as, as election, election day, is larger, larger when, there are, are fewer, year s, s election, election has, the recent, recent past, past and, and also, also lowerquality, lowerquality polls65, the uncertainty, than it, it was, was in, or 2012, the uncertainty, uncertainty is, a statebystate, statebystate basis, basis so, like georgia, georgia are, less uncertainty, alaska uncertainty, is larger, with one, take one, one state, the democrat, democrat ahead, ahead by, points and, and another, the democrat, democrat is, republican in, in one, one poll, poll but, ahead in, in another, another the, the democrat, democrat has, has a, a 5point, lead in, in the, polling average, in both, we ve, ve found, the state, disagree with, with one, is larger, the polling, polling average, with the, the state, another reason, reason for, the state, much weight, weight you, you place, place on, on it, it is, is to, to get, get a, a sense, sense for, for whether, whether it, consistent story, story with, with the, ve found, is more, more divergence, divergence between, in kansas, kansas this, the uncertainty, higher uncertainty, is larger, larger when, there are, this is, intuitive assumption, in the, the data, data a, a lot, of senate, year feature, high uncertainty, viable thirdparty, with very, high volatility, volatility uncertainty, is larger, the race, race is, is more, this is, is the, the one, isn t, t the, the outcome, in doubt, doubt when, when the, close race, race of, of course, course it, it is, is if, if you, you re, concerned about, about who, but as, the difference, difference between, between the, polled and, and the, actual margin, the race, race the, the error, to be, be larger, larger when, there is, is a, a bigger, bigger gap, for instance, for a, a candidate, candidate up, by 40, points in, in the, her race, race by, points or, or 50, instead step, the probability, probability of, each party, the senate, senate once, once we, we ve, completed step, step 6, we ve, mean the, republican is, is ahead, ahead by, points and, standard deviation, deviation plus, or minus, points for, for the, the forecast, in each, each state, state as, as i, can use, normal distribution, distribution to, to calculate, calculate a, a candidate, candidate s, win probability, these two, so why, why not, just stop, minor reason, reason is, because the, the fivethirtyeight, fivethirtyeight model, normal distribution, distribution instead, instead it, a transformation, normal distribution, distribution with, the transformation, might mean, mean for, for example, that we, we would, a candidate, candidate with, with a, percent chance, chance to, his race, race instead, instead of, percent chance, chance but, but this, this process, process is, is not, complicated and, little difference, difference instead, instead we, deal with, with a, couple of, of more, problems one, one is, the error, independent from, from state, state to, to state, state in, a number, one party, party has, has either, considerable ground, the closing, the race, race as, or the, had a, bias toward, toward one, one party, party or, on election, election day, in 1994, and 2012, this property, property is, is not, same two, on the, the ballot, in each, each state, state but, but it, enough to, to worry, as i, in step, the model, overall amount, amount of, of error, each state, based on, the election, election the, the volume, the number, number of, running the, the model, the error, national error, error and, and statespecific, same way, statespecific error, error as, one state, state at, at a, a time, time in, in each, each simulation, simulation the, the program, program draws, draws a, first number, national error, error in, in one, one simulation, for instance, instance the, draw might, might be, every state, state in, that simulation, simulation then, then it, another number, in each, each state, in arkansas, for instance, instance it, to produce, produce a, simulated result, result in, in each, each state, state in, in arkansas, this example, example it, mean the, the democrat, democrat mark, mark pryor, his projection, projection by, poor night, if pryor, his opponent, opponent by, fewer than, points or, by any, any margin, would be, enough to, to win, the race, race in, that simulation, simulation if, if he, he d, been behind, behind more, more than, points he, he d, d still, come up, short70 in, in this, this way, can estimate, estimate not, candidate s, s chance, chance of, winning but, number of, each party, party will, the possibility, that it, it could, could be, be a, like 1994, or 2012, when almost, almost all, the same, same direction, direction the, the simulation, simulation is, is also, helpful for, viable thirdparty, such as, larry pressler, pressler of, of south, south dakota71, dakota71 who, couple of, the range, range of, symmetric a, a thirdparty, thirdparty candidate, at 15, percent with, with some, some time, time to, to go, the race, some chance, chance not, a lot, lot of, points and, at 35, percent in, which case, case he, he could, as i, i ve, can be, be volatile72, volatile72 but, but he, he has, has no, no chance, chance of, points and, at 5, percent73 so, so we, we model, the vote, on a, lognormal distribution, distribution which, this type, type of, of asymmetry, to one, the majorparty, to trade, gubernatorial election, election in, in 2010, for example, the independent, independent eliot, eliot cutler, cutler was, was left, left of, of center, center and, much closer, closer to, to the, the democrat, democrat libby, libby mitchell, mitchell than, republican candidate, candidate paul, paul lepage, began to, to gain, gain ground, ground late, the race, race almost, almost all, taken from, from mitchell, from lepage, lepage the, the model, this by, the ideology, in step, in south, south dakota, example pressler, pressler s, s vote, vote share, share pressler, pressler is, republican is, correlated with, with the, republican mike, the democrat, democrat rick, rick weiland, weiland so, so in, when pressler, back most, most of, of his, the very, very last, last step, counting up, number of, in each, each simulation, simulation and, them to, to the, the baseline, baseline of, not up, for grabs, grabs this, the model, to one, one of, on how, how we, we do, greg orman, of kansas, kansas has, he ll, ll caucus, caucus with, whichever
