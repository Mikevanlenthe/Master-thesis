pressler, makes the uncertainty, backing out a, to mean the, congressional ballot polls25, polls can produce, in methodology but, centerleft independent candidate, so the state, portrayal of election,

reid s win, a probability distribution, translate, fivethirtyeight senate model, the election day, seeks to estimate, about the overall, the very last, we owe you, through our house, if a pollster, calculate a projection, more with one, very last step, as important is, average a mainstream, where the democrat, data34, default the fivethirtyeight, be a forecast, senators by definition, with a couple, it s almost, their last reelection, presidential race you, the republican bill, possibility that it, model we calculate, win as i, i can get, play in the, practice as it, a poll is, but not so, day or romney, in the closing, to look beyond, how the fivethirtyeight, voter adjustment is, buffer, sample, the republican s, which reflect a, the election64 this, right now it, by treating the,

it, performance, of the other, program and we, comparisons from one, a field goal, affect the candidate, hagan of north, estimate the ideology, meant to be, in which a, bid such as, poll so a, past has little, has no chance, for example wang, no polling or, or a candidate, edition, could be almost, done it by, point when she, one party has, and whenever obama, been dormant for, given state just, of controlling the, a firm with, make some difference, the candidate is, year this is, poll with a, reflects the benefit, at all one, the senate once, minutes to play, with some other, the weight is, calculated and how, the fivethirtyeight model, of three systems49, retaining the senate, percent chance to, a sound basis, launched the forecasts9, at dataforecastmethodology update, check them out, well calibrated in, race the error, incumbent, more accurate and, across thousands76 of, s election has, the 109th congress, to make them, them the worse, conservative socalled tea, of the campaign, amount, sen claire mccaskill, however i want, a bit dull, event the state, it estimated she, truth, alone after step, cutler, same survey22 so, as in kansas, senate once we, about 02 percentage, super, is larger when, chance not a, by election day, drop me a, a single bad, have engaged in, at a time, ideology of a, the senate model, it does not, year the trend, s the model, gain, a weighted average, be empirical simplicity, that vote very, of kansas has, between an 85, have little idea, in that simulation, of 4 percentage, to one we, was zero by, this point in, available information in, polls can t, data a lot, volatile72 but he, more influence on, margin, that the democrat, graphic below for, reason, as in 1994, has more influence, for instance a, candidate and then, projection, it was 11, in any event, variables43 but it, that each has, average difference between, a mean of, an associate professor, a net of, points candidate ideology, in the coming, science, who did not, as an estimate, weiland, but one is, our senate model, for grabs this, vice president joe, a long history, to show a, a bit simpler, delaware, points instead of, the implication is, deviation to 2, by calculating a, or minus 5, but it s, questions just drop, release our pollster, that chance to, harry, error in a, goal with two, obama, the same two, just 1 point, worse the candidate, count, analysis on all, the adjustment is, with additional fundraising42, reelection by about, likely voter version19, recent senate election, going on from, length, or 92 percent, into a single, however the model, some statistical property, idea, happened in some, to poll a, alaska and louisiana, delaware as the, has a 5point, way principle 1, best test of, additional point when, that in recent, wang, someone, fivethirtyeight presidential model, rather than an, a 2point shift, that each candidate, in practice as, a close race, arkansas for instance, detail, from some of, treat registered voter, of campaigns since, kentucky louisiana minnesota, impact, to gain ground, fivethirtyeight model is, with a standard, to be larger, held this is, accuracy16 and on, consistent from election, outperformed his projection, but just as, relative, the next about, change in win, bill, model made sharron, polls alone it, media coverage of, poll for instance, just a computer, the democrat mark, can be volatile72, adjustment is an, are the main, step, poll but 10, that it could, election in 2010, same as when, this variable is, higher than it, points instead step, independent eliot cutler, less important variables43, much more depth, have some tendency, are combined into, change, examples like this, misconduct for instance, going forward truth, will win and, forecasts in 2010, like to call, a problem if, the us house, office held this, something from his, consonants a candidate, in the recent, trend, convention this calculation, intuitive uncertainty is, raised by each, in the fourth, polls for instance, assumption, case see the, track record of, the improvement in, for 2014 and, estimates the uncertainty, from a 12point, them together it, we ve done, of the same, the election the, error, or as one, however the prediction, the republican incumbent, all the important, percentage points the, calibrated we ve, tend to get, in minimizing the, in all the, simulate outcomes and, tea, for example arkansas, the candidate ideology, polls have done, fundamentals another reason, attention, in addition to, they ve been, explicitly meant to, here an nfl, correlated with larger, very high volatility, placed more emphasis, alone it helps, you can check, of large cities45, results across thousands76, seats his forecast, are changing in, whichever, policy50 the score, him the race, and 95 percent, that past election, them and we, in kentucky or, louisiana, ranging from gay, forecast63 and we, of their party, days to go, normal distribution to, transparency initiative17 and, our forecast page, and 2012 this, the first quarter, we in turn, presidential forecast model, are pretty great, whether the polling, think of this, a candidate and, that buffer zone, state to state, party or another, drew linzer s, in this way, just drop me, simulation then it, with an 11point, as state senator, the highest office, akin in missouri, fact while fivethirtyeight, another the democrat, computer program and, statistically significant in, more confident as, pm, ahead it wouldn, nevada against harry, re concerned about, this stuff but, can be a, favorite likewise a, toward overconfidence unless, her race by, within the margin, likewise when pressler, tend to be, just above 3, harry reid it, from two different, minor reason is, had been well, as low as, weighted polling average, in 2008 a, tomorrow the fivethirtyeight, party instead it, reference, suddenly began to, gain of 51, test, margin of error2, that simulation then, favorite in nevada, of the majorparty, as of tuesday, power in senate, something to it, an nfl team, in missouri in, million and the, weighting an otherwise, the independent eliot, in step 2, an earlier version, chance, gives back most, toward the future, wrote the program, when the race, much about a, points and another, particular the model, wide range and, fundraising42, there is more, almost all of, tax policy50 the, eliot cutler was, we think most, by the candidate, in a number, polling along with, are very different, record in congress, they determine the, through pacs or, provocation, an impressive 85, polling38, s to make, that registered voter, majorparty, for each candidate, this historic average, although there are, in this type, by 3 points28, the firm rasmussen, tried to keep, of the house, tendency to converge, romney, assume the error, determined we ve, to the election13, year or if, to win in, view, poll weights are, calculating them in, be statistical noise, had performed under, tantamount to a, an economic index, one another uncertainty, simpler and has, course of the, democrats as i, predicting the 2016, does for instance, percentage points as, by about 5, them out for, that we know, generic ballot however, wrong to assume, her to win, the overall amount, model should be, i ll describe, poll s sample, independent from state, story, in a candidate, theory, candidate included20 we, the weight in, heavier weight in, are much weaker, she was 2, presidential model we, as though it, for current or, for instance the, according to the, in the model, regression analysis the, remain near their, for instance quinnipiac, in 2012 it, winners of recent, fundamentals calculation has, candidates or party, of comparing a, percent it doesn, much more uncertainty, debate, dull from day, pretty great but, approval, democrat mark pryor, that the same, won her race, another intuitive assumption, an additional point, percent73 so we, might anticipate an, quite a bit, implication, variation, particular day favor, a 60 percent, consistent pattern this, this is because, based on two, shot, gap separating the, noise, began to gain, which i ll, but that came, favorite however the, enough to worry, average23 gap has, seats as they, of the poll, voting, her up by, come up short70, and registered voter, shot to be, make much difference, step 7 simulate, supposed to be, from his lead, an unweighted average,
