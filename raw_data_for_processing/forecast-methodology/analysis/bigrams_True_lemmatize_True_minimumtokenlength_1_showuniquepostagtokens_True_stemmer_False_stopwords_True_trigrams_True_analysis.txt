this, than an estimate, instance, to time, theory one, slight refinement, something to, having a poor, it s just, statebystate basis so, reason for, before election, contrast, so in, may not, the

forecast model, some chance, just drop, history, toward overconfidence, can use a, news media place, win to a, everything, the magnitude of, first presidential debate, fewer than, you something victory, if he, placed on this, forecast like the, i ll describe, outperformed his projection, a variety of, reason to look, with an average, is the one, get the data, contrast if, pretty intuitive uncertainty, pacs or, day result, less and less, an economic index, instance sen kay, according to, can think, but one, of the fact, course it, at 15 percent, is larger, like 9 percentage, overall partisan mood, as in 1994, country, produces a probability, that he d, event the, for much more, run it, s a problem, senate election, although there are, so with, picking up at, though such a, or as

but if, fivethirtyeight senate, he has, two different turnout, looking at, tweak the forecast, can be a, practice as, to 986 percent, guilty of, misconduct for instance, because we don, polling38 in,
