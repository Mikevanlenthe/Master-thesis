but, for much more, much more uncertainty, more uncertainty reid, reid win came, model instead 30000to1, instead 30000to1 underdog, wang those are, those are very, are very different, examples like this, like this wang, projected republican gain, seats the house, the house 2010, house 2010 but, but with margin, with margin error, margin error just, just plus minus, plus minus two, seats his forecast, that odds against, republicans picking least, were trillionsandtrillionsto1 against36, trillionsandtrillionsto1 against36 you, estimates the uncertainty, the uncertainty more, recommend the

article which, which outlines the, detailed side tried, tried keep the, language often possible, somewhat more technical, meant reasonably comprehensive, bedtime reading first, first however want,

often the, the most important, and often the, likely outcome the, will win the, sometimes relatively immune, changes methodology but, methodology but probabilistic, probabilistic forecasts can, can very sensitive, that 3point lead, lead translate into, chance winning percent, chance what this, what this can, this can tricky, like that the, error expressed poll, expressed poll complete, sometimes don hold, real world our, polls conducted the, conducted the final, fell outside the, poll reported margin, the time3 important, taking shortcuts fact, shortcuts fact while, are sometimes seen, seen extremely bold, when compared with, news media coverage, are fairly conservative, conservative compared with, forecasting models for, for variety reasons5, variety reasons5 statistical, are prone toward, designed carefully the, best test probabilistic, calibrated that mean, out all fivethirtyeight, forecasts that give, candidates about percent, about percent shot, fact win about, over the long, run problem these, win only percent, but from statistical, standpoint just much, time fortunately fivethirtyeight, have historically been, github that you, that you can, for yourself for,

about percent, doesn make huge, what more complete, matter this year, because both individual, and the overall, are close most, following way first, most likely outcome, likely outcome particular, state the republican, they determine the, determine the degree, this means normal, distribution something similar, this type statistical, outcomes within the, equally likely instead, those closer the, are more probable, probable the graphic, example illustrates normal, normal distribution with, distribution with mean, polls and standard, deviation this example, example take positive, values mean the, mean the republican, race and negative, values mean the, according the normal, normal distribution the, distribution the republican, will win percent, but shift the, toward the republican, republican say our, than someone else, projects her win, instead has noticeable, probabilities not huge, huge but noticeable, from being percent, being percent favorite, contrast given the, given the republican, the republican additional, she was already, already well ahead, wouldn make much, difference she were, the polls for, instance she already, she already 977, according the normal, increase that chance, there another way, another way can, probability changing the, the example below, below kept the, kept the republican, but reduced the, points instead now, she suddenly percent, view far too, far too little, attention paid those, questions what the, forecast opposed the, most likely result, forecasters name unless, have something positive, say about them, think most the, out there are, there are pretty, but one much, that requires some, put together sam, associate professor molecular, that model wrong, necessarily because shows, barely shows any, shows any republican,

candidates about, the candidates fact, these candidates win, problem they win, senate forecasts have, instances6 where gave, election day the, won cases percent, time7 also have, election forecasts and, forecasts principle good, that only few, things really matter, removed all the, superfluous bits but, model you may, when sometimes does, voter polls the, voter polls when, voter polls tend,

its rules midstream, midstream sometimes guilty, program and wrote, program however don, from year year, largely similar our, these models have, nonpolling data have, polls there are, polls discard first, pollsters that know, their results have, behalf candidates party, campaign committee and, three factors how, older polls are, penalty becomes stiffer, the news media, recency and would, poll sample size, polls that sample, more voters not, the reasons for, pollster ratings but, poll heavily just, previous years when, emphasis sample size15, pollster ratings for, that pollsters are, accuracy16 and two, measurable proxies for, industry groups and, cellphones addition landlines18, these factors don, everything you need, but they tend, methodological variables are, strong predictors more, poll weights don, exception given how, races there are, pollsters routinely poll, these cases don, but gets lower, pollster lists both, cases where the, multiple versions the, instance results drawn, polls which contain, new respondents each, step adjustments the, model performs three, sets adjustments the, polls likely voter, likely voters are, favorable republicans than, than polls broader, registered voters but, likely voters also, voters also tend, midterm years default, voter polls and, toward republicans make, voter surveys particular, registered voters toward, percentage

democrats benefit, stronger results for, pattern this year, inferences about how, the polls are, other states for, the inferences are, for changes the, sample populations for, registered voters and, out time trend, average each state, toward republicans average, percentage points let, probability distributions one, big differences between, models that look, only polls and, other factors but, percent doesn make, individual states and, first they calculate, republican wins point, then they determine, most models this, all outcomes within, likely instead those, instead those closer, the polls and, this example take, positive values mean, republican wins the, negative values mean, model averages the, win points instead, the probabilities not, ahead wouldn make, were points the, points instead would, would only increase, lead points but, deviation points instead, win view far, result don like, other forecasters name, name unless have, shows democrats ahead, polling averages and, win probabilities for, for candidates with, small leads the, polling averages have, several assumptions about, how polls behave, check out against, overconfident forecasts 2010, was points ahead, the polls but, above35 would have, forecasts there are, gain seats the, two seats his, least seats they, against36 you want, polls only model, more rigorously recommend, fundamentals calculation which, ultimately doesn have, two candidates are, make comparisons from, races where the, state fundamentals are, guide they miss, percentage points why, you sometimes have, this year have, the polls alone, alone helps have, both states are, abrupt shifts the, for democrats michigan, races more line, fundamentals calculation has, state fundamentals estimate, indicators that have, senate races their, the indicators are, the republicans about, toward incumbents regardless, party right now, approval ratings remain, historic lows which, which mitigates some, reasons can reflect, grassroots support for,
