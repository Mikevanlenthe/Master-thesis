arizona, all and, has to, pretty huge difference, way, the administration ahead, answer 0, time, for trump 4730, clinton, tea party but, the are, lot of, trump change his, m gon, that s far, ok, brand, after it became, was 84 percent, vote for trump, trump micah is, ripe for, can trump, is the, important to trump, comparison pence s, much influence, different than, trump group harry, to do the, with that i, the american people, poll about bannon, mean the, it ok one, someone on, generic republican would, reelect percentage, i mean, clinton went, ok last part, expect people who, they a majority, yeah, party but he, the way, general election to, country but i, and midwest is, polarizing people harry, from 15, he isn t, everything he, average voter, is will, glad you, trump approve 95, is not, popular vote, it became, to make, group is, backs up nate, trump 28, at pleasing his, the right micah, fan of the, the 42 percent, not just skip, harry more, opponent i d, mike pence for, s departure clare, in one, mean ‚Ä¶ it, what i find, part because a, to make trump, i guess, percent, departure clare you, for him and, trump than, voters approve, as hell, kick, trump can do, for kasich s, him harry, moderate democrat, percent in june, were a couple, can imagine, can take from, are you, disorderly conduct in, question right, put donald, midterms claremalone trump, michael, the

datareluctanttrump, run, a huge fan, coping mechanism, the are you, natesilver the bigger, you make of, claremalone trump, last part, presidency he, love ‚Ä¶ micah, you gon na, there was a, now i m, today we, the state of, but the percentage, disapprove of, interviewed aug 1821, with the reluctant, rather than 2, they polled 3227, ‚Äì definitely vote, night, that s less, natesilver i, le, a chance, vote for someone, for better or, think pence, vote trump right, to the president, both that bannon, runs against him, to say he, than trump 23, that question in, base, respondents think pence, him in fact, claremalone bannon s, better off 37, vote by 5, how conservative are, in some, substantial slide natesilver, are conservative but, is the us, not sure, claremalone, job is, he did natesilver, the trump, for a democrat, the percentage, s sort of, than the media, would be, is smaller than, take from, of them are, consequence for trump, hell, really by comparison, voters makes sense, after trump s, conservative he, transcript below has, tbh claremalone, of democrat, yeah he s, thing harry one, charlottesville and, t vote, percent say, how the, chance, be a, political writer, claremalone and we, trump s, source surveymonkey claremalone, he would be, moves for better, not enough influence, arizona speech, s sort, of his people, kamala harris, just got, leader, surveymonkey harry more, win reelection, could shoot, surface, i d, the man, kasich s independent, micah is pence, independent bid andor, the surveymonkey poll, to clare, for reelection in, man, bannonish claremalone bannon, about them onebyone, think it is, base of, that great, strongly disapprove of, percent strongly approve, to prevail next, their approval, lukewarm on him, are getting more, change if president, trump s 2016, guess steve bannon, just skip straight, claremalone i, as shadow president, s far, s departure, trump s speech, conservative i, last one how, natesilver i ve, the excited trump, trump too, even or i, natesilver nate silver, the man doesn, the vote, job among trump, approval rating harry, claremalone i kinda, harry and, role he s, worse and, hillary clinton and, so ‚Ä¶ i, really want to, is interesting claremalone, ‚Äì 25, can do to, vote trump not, for our weekly, what percentage, might be the, avenue, after trump, office ie he, in june, it s fan, t after it, trump administration, to cast their, this week s, answer 1, american people didn, said trump, removed from office, trump sample, fan of, among nonreluctant trump, tea partier, the excited and, micah ok to, his arizona, harry the other, guess if this, andor, survey of, a base, didn t buy, to outweigh the, republicans about trump, some a, of the country, marco rubio for, right amount, generic republican natesilver, so glad, writer, t expect people, wrong direction question, more moderate and, he s, country but, back in, right amount claremalone, decent margin, it s sort, we should note, presidency, well hold on, chat to talk, that dynamic is, college by, for trump if, would mike pence, because a lot, take a chance, datareluctanttrump in, party and, next time around, of the overall, for a few, views of trump, i m, for a, should note, might not, bid andor, was a separate, behind the administration, the top in, their dream candidate, where trump, and trump, by trump and, party and they, talk, imagine the someone, i guess if, influence 49, are worried harry, one will, does trump stand, trump administration ‚Ä¶, of his arizona, substantial slide, expect people, pleasing his most, wouldn t, aftermath of charlottesville, wasn t a, the reluctant trump, president trump will, malone, someone anyone, bigger question is, i m not, he is natesilver, nate silver editor, and may, someone though, ‚Äì 59, natesilver pence is, far less than, i want to, bannon s departure, i find, a majority, yeah he, or some sort, harry one, than they, ‚Äì 10, for trump whoever, pence presidency, departure ‚Ä¶, vote for him, quite sure how, micah perfect, ‚Äì 2, ie he, ‚Ä¶, had the term, party but, you wouldn t, the biggest fan, s behavior micah, ‚Äì 37, question i ask, these reluctant trump, last time we, democratic candidate who, closer to the, to talk, by trump, just 30 percent, t like, m not sure, we ll talk, but i, that this administration, to imagine a, s a, of people, s longterm, a little different, m not a, question i, d rather, just want someone, is the point, a bit player, wrong direction, had the right, that he wasn, margin claremalone, administration s, bit player, run for reelection, takeaway from this, of it claremalone, his or, other more, relatively welleducated less, wrong direction 36, harry we, a bit, surveymonkey harry, couple of, today we re, that s, points rather, toward not, pleasing, between aug, midwest is, trump win, both trump and, perfect ‚Ä¶ so, and clinton went, the republican party, rubio for, more enthused trump, part, partier, with trump no, prevail next, percentage, huge difference, consequence, love, it is, ‚Äì, claremalone well, a lot, a john, i don t, still the one, voted for him, very few, probably vote, github data, question and, be better, group wan, do in office, s one will, s website breitbart, welleducated less, agree with clare, dreams a john, voters would go, little different and, close us out, s difficult, amount claremalone, can get, light which, if this question, poll about, his people would, surveymonkey claremalone so, points for trump, about reluctant trump, be some sort, no matter, surveymonkey on how, to the, moderate enough while, alienate the people, some a marco, likely 9 ‚Äì, datareluctanttrump, administration, lure them, ripe, opponent i, consequence for, pence would be, for rossperotredux harry, in arizona on, trump a better, main takeaway, was a, democrat joe, minute ‚Ä¶ how, the narrative of, conservative in the, be better than, he would, the administration s, yeahhhh do you, pence for a, pence a, unwillingness to vote, the media last, on the surface, answer 8, though claremalone, last resort, right amount of, and we, from 74 percent, who didn t, to all üòÄ, vote 1, the surveymonkey, who approve of, percentage is smaller, i kinda, fifth avenue, reelection, approve of trump, making a, run again he, scene, agree with harry, shadow president so, realistic view, vote trump a, the bigger question, big effect, the someone, vote trump approve, we check, might be, like it, we can take, june but the, want to do, of a bit, stay with trump, little different, june claremalone, in 2020, of his, the white house, crucial in 2018, because a voter, more time, because a, lukewarm, a few or, harry, kind, s arizona speech, demonized by, your main, doing worse, election, if president trump, the surface among, influence 22, no answer 8, nate s point, from 15 percent, harry i m, and not, outweigh the, more realistic view, the wake, ‚Äì 5, wake of charlottesville, someone else 5, trump stand, guess if, conventional leader, between the, michael bloomberg, particular case the, exit, say they are, is feeling they, the overall, political writer well, to return to, disliked both trump, this group is, reelection with the, anyone, survey of 3227, clinton and they, his performance harry, a john kasich, a course change, it s, than the average, departure, over trump micah, percent claremalone but, down 11 percentage, mr silver natesilver, na throw, but he isn, exit poll, source surveymonkey micah, his most, better than, generic republican to, case, worse natesilver, to reelect trump, candidate is, for both, back to, shadow, will steve bannon, a moderate, as moderate but, s arizona, we check back, speech in arizona, a tea, divide, impact of, june, gon na throw, best light, speech in, reelect trump 63, micah it is, would go for, ‚Äì survey, hoping that they, the people who, reelect trump 28, i ask, with trump, charlottesville but, to have, clare malone, to that question, batch of data, marco rubio, mechanism for people, rating harry tell, percentage of people, sure we ever, administration has very, for president trump, as they, trump could shoot, is a case, was worth, micah this, points from 74, natesilver yeah, s departure ‚Ä¶, of the impact, has steve, percent of, and i guess, loyal to the, at all, departure clare, medium, claremalone clare malone, i also, it is yeah, generic republican, on him, tea party, cast their ballot, right micah this, different than president, a few, m not, this group wan, her dreams a, by comparison, a hypothetical or, t like trump, pence presidency he, why mr, in june claremalone, maybe they, be some, why not just, ‚Äì probably vote, effect on the, i m so, time we, in that question, in the, better president than, are a bit, website breitbart, own base, candidate is will, look, huge fan of, or wrong direction, independent bid, this data, with clare you, few or, like it s, view of the, micah i, accomplishment, is pence a, kick in, t a, give us a, think pence would, much and, cut, who didn, a net, from office, question in, him natesilver, sort, micah micah, lot, trump is, ‚Äì a 3227, he wasn, data at, influence 22 %, ‚Äì not, the north and, trump will, resort to, better president, success, survey was, the reluctant group, on pence, filed under, do we ask, a case, steve bannon the, perot to run, conservative he was, vote trump better, s speech, part because, would not vote, the statistic one, you gon, definition claremalone clare, speech but, around harry, dream, bit worse, i do wonder, else 5, ripe for rossperotredux, thing to, to resign, can trump win, prevail next time, which i m, impact of bannon, batch, donald trump, point of, claremalone trump could, it ok, term tea, ie he would, love ‚Ä¶, people would, it s time, the trump administration, approval, chance on him, in the right, not vote, s generic as, the country but, right now i, among trump, state, narrative of bannon, electoral college, for people, reasons trump did, micah can trump, biggest fan, reelection in, to resign it, he d, the average voter, north and, question is still, gon na, the wake of, trump no matter, they think trump, president s job, sure how, claremalone trump s, far less, republican natesilver, do you, term tea party, of trump than, talk about, punditize, candidate pence, bannon ‚Ä¶ if, behavior harry, right, claremalone it, this is a, of reluctant trump, president s, overall sample, all and we, split, the 42, tell us, welcome all today, some of his, republican party, and they, micah next ‚Ä¶, source surveymonkey, harry he s, way president trump, fan, sure we, before that s, seeing for him, thing to me, note, him again, there has to, vote for kamala, of them, end, the white, republican to, as shadow, all üòÄ, gon, wonder, trump micah or, media last one, direction question, clare, percent say they, the north, the people, democrats and reluctant, micah ok, have a big, micah is, some sort, the vote to, behavior harry we, both clinton, s your main, lukewarmness won t, making, he was, we can get, trump right direction, group this, conservative are they, tuesday night which, moderate and, percent claremalone, this group, average voter s, a potential mike, lack, and then we, rating, moderate and less, mike pence presidency, this administration, trump better off, behavior, a marco rubio, difficult to imagine, arizona, mean you, the popular vote, moderate democrat joe, m so, far closer to, a decent margin, go for, in part, silver natesilver because, i d rather, to do, joe manchin, clinton and trump, has steve bannon, voters micah wait, people who, tuesday, harry he, course change given, rossperotredux, him i mean, both reluctant trump, bannon s, moderate but, we ll, in one minute, conduct in, why do, in the best, that sorta, candidate, the term tea, say they, said trump won, themselves as moderate, in 2016, what role he, the electoral college, what percentage of, something natesilver, resort, harry i, did natesilver i, micah ah, enough influence on, based on the, more 2020 question, course, to run again, better or, less brand loyal, bit, claremalone but it, that means the, for trump s, likely 61 %, harry harry, influence on trump, candidate micah, bigger question, tell us why, ‚Äì no different, interesting claremalone, do to, claremalone bannon, excited to, june claremalone and, editor, would lure them, for him again, wasn t, m gon na, trump s reluctant, can get perot, trump because he, primary challenge natesilver, time around, that was worth, poll, a marco, didn t vote, percent who, in the north, influence 21, going in, the bigger, chance on, trump a, and aug, in part because, better than worse, democratic candidate is, question and then, strongly approve of, of end point, a coping mechanism, cast their, claremalone so, the best light, it s difficult, one minute ‚Ä¶, the 2020, we ask, of the president, cohen, is pence, fairly nuancedlayered and, trumpers natesilver pence, first place natesilver, trump 57, likely at all, a couple of, t making a, base ‚Ä¶, could shoot someone, influence 21 ‚Äì, a better, trump 63, rating was, majority 53, and more, donald trump over, vote trump too, became clear how, that mean harry, wake of, than trump, didn t, the one behind, office ie, about bannon, some of, definition, to talk about, clinton and, percentage of, his performance, skip, midterm, ‚Äì 60, s independent bid, take everything he, statistic one, s time, headed in, the approval, mean harry, fivethirtyeight, would be a, micah boring, change his, the right direction, just 30, statistic one more, re both more, minute, joe, claremalone so 45, away a moderate, i think the, bannon, how this, voter, enthusiastic trump voter, of charlottesville but, conservative but, that just 30, president pence, source, president so, like pence, the transcript below, of charlottesville, matching someone up, check back, right direction or, doing worse than, group, more conventional leader, for some a, this lukewarm, disapprove of his, you all and, hell tbh claremalone, that question, the president, approve of, go for a, the average, answer, a separate, arizona on, probably vote to, fairly substantial slide, worth a net, less on people, s favorable rating, % ‚Äì, the administration, so loyal to, percent strongly disapprove, what s your, democratic candidate, the country, trump 4730, so loyal, challenge, we just, has very, next ‚Ä¶, it claremalone trump, challenge natesilver, surveymonkey on, making a lot, that the, should be more, s less, new batch of, would want to, also agree with, influence has, if president pence, immigration, is natesilver the, trump stand with, bannon the man, than worse natesilver, mean, be 90 micah, of people who, in office, check back in, else of his, someone, the aftermath, you ‚Ä¶, writing about this, what is the, not quite sure, my takeaway, mr, president than, sort of consequence, the percentage of, generic as, nothing, a huge, s pretty, the transcript, no different, senior political
