natesilver, playing, not just skip, s question about, him from those, they polled 3227, donald trump over, performance, or wrong direction, vote trump not, that s far, he would be, seeing for him, or for worse, micah it is, to the president, a pretty huge, who would lure, source surveymonkey harry, but i also, want to repeat, of it claremalone, term tea party, takeaway from this, micah perfect ‚Ä¶, s fan fic, no answer 8, still love him, cuts against the, of them are, had the term, agree with harry, challenge natesilver with, after trump s, dreams a john, trump voter natesilver, would want to, bigger question is, effect on the, harry we all, filed under the, generic republican would, no answer 4, is interesting claremalone, a huge fan, bannon the man, base, he s sort, why not just, substantial slide natesilver, worse and i, anyone to make, be more focus, pence would be, about them onebyone, departure clare you, part because a, speech, president trump will, in the north, question is still, that said trump, wonder, voting for him, to prevail next, role, down from 15, perfect, the transcript below, nate silver editor, making a lot, group this lukewarm, t expect people, micah is pence, biggest fan of, claremalone trump could, lukewarm, claremalone clare malone, primary challenge natesilver, that s immigration, a definition claremalone, thing, both reluctant trump, trumpers natesilver pence, approve of the, talk, how this group, why do we, republican would want, impact of bannon, in arizona on, it s time, amount claremalone yeahhhh, take a chance, harry harry i, get perot to, who approve of, andor primary challenge, a coping mechanism, influence 22 %, amount, the country was, vote trump very, transcript below has, course change given, to the are, on github github, not vote 1, look, end, percent which is, role he s, i d rather, her dreams a, different than president, among reluctant trump, to outweigh the, claremalone but it, skip straight to, ripe for rossperotredux, fairly nuancedlayered and, than president trump, democrat over trump, at pleasing his, claremalone i kinda, mean the lack, i agree with, m gon na, should be more, matter, the 2020 election, that backs up, really by comparison, enthusiastic trump voter, democratic candidate is, micah, of trump than, points for trump, but the percentage, a decent margin, this particular case, worth a net, kind, ‚Äì not very, amount of influence, much and not, ie, we should note, fan, relatively welleducated less, of the overall, strongly disapprove of, man, approval rating harry, this survey was, change if president, than the 42, wrong direction 36, percent in june, leader than trump, vote trump a, ‚Äì 37 ‚Äì, m so glad, think pence would, to make trump, june but the, make trump change, disorderly conduct in, margin claremalone i, think trump is, trump stand with, has very few, margin, likely at all, to talk about, definition claremalone clare, socially conservative he, claremalone, voter can imagine, couple, going in the, some a marco, of charlottesville and, if this question, a moderate democrat, of a bit, their dream candidate, worse than they, and excited trump, run, ‚Äì, guess, administration has very, from 74 percent, of trump s, bannon ‚Ä¶ if, if president pence, the same as, based on the, won in part, a bit player, a net of, popular vote by, people harry i, for him natesilver, themselves as moderate, the first place, were held today, joe, below has been, place, i think the, vote, party and they, unwillingness to vote, way president trump, t after it, not enough influence, will steve bannon, a course change, worse than he, have a big, a john kasich, what percentage of, and then we, shielded in some, surveymonkey harry more, can take from, in november micah, that same voter, for reelection in, between aug 18, probably vote for, he was a, editor in chief, want to vote, so glad you, but it s, also agree with, harry, yeah he s, us a definition, the electoral college, its own base, i want to, m not a, social conservative i, from surveymonkey on, how conservative are, first place natesilver, sure we ever, that maybe they, because a voter, has to be, college, again he ll, micah ok to, for kasich s, i do wonder, s departure clare, favorable rating was, ah, for president trump, and aug 21, mean harry harry, for a democrat, alienate, about reluctant trump, that s less, ‚Ä¶ among trump, there has to, vote for him, harry he s, electoral college by, time around harry, nate s point, of charlottesville but, makes sense harry, then we ll, which is not, and i guess, disapprove of the, his favorable rating, more conventional leader, don t like, did natesilver i, someone, for him in, of the impact, percent strongly approve, less brand loyal, batch of data, answer, bid, the media last, ‚Äì no different, a better president, what i might, something, resign, it ok one, impact, of reluctant trump, can imagine the, reasons trump did, statistic one more, the state of, to run again, for a few, but he isn, harry tell us, closer to the, if the 2020, who like pence, some of them, is smaller than, to reelect trump, question in one, mechanism, who didn t, i m so, to trump micah, trump approve 95, and clinton went, points from 74, and steve bannon, source, clinton and trump, speech in arizona, feel about the, the american people, the lack of, important to trump, does trump stand, reluctant group this, moderate enough while, trump can do, far closer to, micah i mean, state, doing worse than, in the white, voters want in, is pence a, sincerely why do, the right amount, average enthusiastic trump, change, too much and, trump over the, datareluctanttrump, some of his, today we re, we check back, in one minute, the surface among, in the right, of end point, mean, comparison pence s, voting behavior harry, generic republican to, approval that s, the right direction, s speech in, love ‚Ä¶ micah, said the country, i guess if, voters makes sense, fact, welcome all today, can do to, survey of 3227, to reelect percentage, i don t, quite sure how, re both more, matching someone up, fan of the, or some sort, removed from office, last one how, handling his job, poll, a last resort, the administration ahead, survey, surface, a little different, a marco rubio, it s sort, that mean harry, with the reluctant, him natesilver i, him in fact, tea, seems like it, ‚Ä¶, surveymonkey, hillary clinton and, why mr silver, independent bid andor, arizona speech but, a new batch, pence be ‚Ä¶, the term tea, source surveymonkey claremalone, just skip straight, direction wrong direction, tell us why, mike pence for, trump administration ‚Ä¶, was a separate, if president trump, conservative i do, reluctant trump group, to the average, right, polarizing people harry, difference, aug 21 i, that just 30, away a moderate, administration, s nothing trump, in office ie, voters would go, interesting claremalone it, natesilver the bigger, crucial in 2018, here s one, cast their ballot, question and then, trump s speech, more powerful has, m not sure, consequence, want to do, him in the, what is the, course, tbh claremalone well, top in 2016, that dynamic is, or a michael, you wouldn t, wouldn t after, the general election, president trump 57, michael, vote 1 ‚Äì, american people didn, data at datareluctanttrump, party but he, that president trump, return, just 30 percent, prove crucial in, guess if this, to all üòÄ, much influence has, make of it, the impact of, would you ‚Ä¶, reluctant trump sample, trump could shoot, aftermath of charlottesville, cohen, to do the, ‚Äì 35 ‚Äì, this administration has, voters micah wait, or disapprove of, vote for kamala, percentage is smaller, come
