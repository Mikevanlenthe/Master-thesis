trump, the media last, to prevail next, rating, alienate, percent in june, survey, points rather than, a chance, no answer 8, fan of, generic as hell, else of, answer, demonized by trump, if this question, by comparison pence, cuts against the, shielded in some, of people, everything, moderate democrat, why not just, his arizona speech, than they, reluctant group, among trump, helped put, voter can imagine, survey was, let s, his favorable rating, both clinton and, s sort of, how the, imagine a, harry i, for some a, sort, dream, percent before, influence on, – 37, – 20, influence on trump, house, clinton went, in the, vote by, today we, want to repeat, talk a bit, all and, election, steve bannon, in this, over trump micah, if president, s pretty, s question, direction or, harry the, to outweigh the, he is, that voters who, view, couple, surveymonkey claremalone, with harry, the people who, people who, breitbart, by trump, based on the, of his arizona, to talk, less brand, – 35, right now i, bannon …, poll about, is feeling they, why mr silver, be 90 micah, better president, i find, bigger question is, some a, this administration has, m not a, slide, mike pence be, stand with the, question in, he d, like trump because, here is, tea party but, lukewarm on, to resign it, wrong direction question, percent of the, tbh claremalone well, s departure …, something, the aftermath, the overall, answer 8, college by, clare s question, m not sure, trump s longterm, between aug 18, who would lure, of the, pence be …, the percentage of, than the media, influence 21, natesilver, for a, senior political writer, someone though, substantial slide, makes sense harry, the right amount, we can get, run again he, because he, it became, pence or, primary challenge natesilver, big effect, question is still, surveymonkey on how, can do, donald trump over, –, leader than, excited to, bannon s departure, said trump won, be some sort, that s, presidential candidate pence, why not, to the president, conduct in, main takeaway, t buy, trump s, take, making a lot, end, in the north, uptick in, way, the electoral college, enthusiastic trump voter, mr silver, s independent bid, was 84 percent, pence and, by comparison, administration has very, question in one, for people who, trump than, not vote 1, tbh, t after, departure …, direction wrong direction, of that question, claremalone so, how conservative are, a base, voters and how, agree with harry, guess if this, expect people, trump won, to reelect trump, long before we, talk a, trump no matter, the man, disapprove of his, slide natesilver, conservative he, that great, but i also, that said trump, the talking point, him i mean, pleasing his most, this lukewarm on, the president s, data at, arizona on, in with, fiscally conservative he, na vote, disapprove of the, has to, there has to, and then, talk about, behavior, micah ah, country but, or wrong direction, generic republican to, and 2020, question and, june but, in that question, and then we, surveymonkey poll about, writing about this, someone else of, of the country, both that bannon, president s, s time, approval question, question is, do we, to cast their, on him, and they, down 11, sample, what role he, brand loyal, yeah he, office ie he, surveymonkey, worse natesilver, would mike pence, – 5 –, the surface among, it s sort, he s, nate s point, the reluctant trump, opponent i, the popular vote, be …, he is natesilver, candidate, hell tbh claremalone, vote to, separate question, the fact, people harry, claremalone trump s, resign it, shielded in, vote trump approve, state, fifth avenue, i wrote, of the impact, what i find, at 553, datareluctanttrump in, tuesday, candidate micah, trump win reelection, trump can do, for people, pence for a, of charlottesville and, because he wasn, could lure, the impact, return, general election to, a thing harry, end point, s fan fic, micah ok, want to, micah, check back, trumpers natesilver pence, player, that maybe they, general election, mechanism, effect, claremalone and we, even or i, might call, the approval, do to, say they are, or someone, it s fan, pence for, relatively welleducated less, enough influence on, come back to, playing, but i, bannon s, vote for him, do in office, are conservative but, claremalone and, can trump win, for trump whoever, the term tea, right amount, group harry, welcome all today, you make of, and excited trump, some a marco, to reelect percentage, pence be, presidency, – probably vote, the one behind, conservative i do, the average voter, the are you, but he, pence, anyone, surveymonkey on, better or, below has been, him in november, i d, a worse president, perfect … so, president, perfect …, a democrat, average voter, claremalone bannon s, that they, and in, – wrong direction, should be more, datareluctanttrump, but he s, cohen, – 12, prove crucial in, socially conservative he, trump 4730, for reelection in, between aug, the country, i think the, andor primary challenge, can take from, website breitbart is, no matter, micah can trump, leader, and his, am trump s, behavior harry we, became clear how, – no, sense, him from those, of influence, it claremalone trump, smaller than the, percentage points from, s speech in, hold on, is still, malone, trump because he, trump approve 95, like it, want to do, strongly approve is, no answer 1, presidential candidate, him in the, claremalone it, worse than, they a majority, a last resort, primary challenge, administration ahead, reluctant a, yeahhhh do, s longterm, really by comparison, early june but, tell us, based on, rather than 2, you …, github github, vote trump very, going in, i guess, i m so, got it ok, this week, were a couple, from this data, in fact, natesilver the bigger, trump voter natesilver, to vote, among nonreluctant trump, micah micah, week s, trump micah or, tea party, source surveymonkey claremalone, s departure, and i, bit worse, and we ll, chief i, would go for, voters would go, writer, harris or, conservative in the, that bannon, arizona speech but, of end point, trump did well, bannon the man, they polled 3227, pleasing his, conservative he is, closer to the, percent claremalone, – survey, about love …, administration …, did last time, s arizona speech, all 😀, as shadow, a lot, democrat over, is natesilver the, for him in, note, from 15, party but he, mechanism for people, on people who, fan fic, has steve bannon, at their approval, ripe for rossperotredux, his behavior micah, you gon na, for both, around harry, he was, worse and i, else of his, man, rubio for, you wouldn t, have a big, put donald, the statistic one, micah or, wouldn t after, right direction, trump too, s departure clare, vote trump too, for a few, to cast, no different, that question right, of them, time, micah i mean, the exit poll, john kasich, because a, thing to, before trump s, speech but, approve is, reelection with the, political writer well, yeahhhh do you, a tea partier, harry and in, both democrats and, or i guess, micah it is, a bit player, a course change, for worse, for trump 4730, chance on, the surveymonkey, welleducated less brand, june claremalone and, could shoot someone, moderate but, s difficult, a better, want in, harry one, the surface, – 3, pence would be, source surveymonkey micah, they think trump, after it, the bigger question, trump over the, something natesilver, do in, s your main, donald trump, excited trump, a pretty huge, a marco rubio, that question i, well micah i, him and not, mike pence, for him from, – 60, claremalone bannon, bit player right, very conservative in, pleasing, the republican party, i m sure, change if president, much and not, percentage of, micah cohen, approve or, group wan, making people, trump micah, hell, them away, american people didn, – 5, a john, views of trump, steve bannon the, thing harry one, this administration, nate silver editor, own base, claremalone yeahhhh do, fairly nuancedlayered and, reelect trump, and clinton went, a few or, wouldn t, an uptick, – 36, man doesn t, mike, fivethirtyeight, a decent margin, if the 2020, joe, and we, someone on, vote for kamala, s far, editor it s, so we, reasons trump did, minute … how, lot of, he wasn, in one minute, in office ie, anyone to make, away a moderate, shoot someone, to run again, so glad you, glad you, clinton and they, generic republican would, the 2020 election, t expect people, has very, party, group is, president than trump, the someone, vote by 5, micah micah cohen, mean you, did natesilver, imagine the, want someone, wake of, is smaller, s for both, approve of, at pleasing his, to talk about, republican party, s immigration, the average, and trump, likely at all, reelection in 2020, not just skip, for him and, vote 1 –, generic republican natesilver, case, the same, bit about bannon, said the country, approve of the, light which, would you …, for trump s, trump will, would be, reluctant trump group, both trump and, question i, is not, micah i, love …, go for, the are, think it s, reluctant group this, crucial in 2018, return to,

before, of his performance, mean the, the excited and, consequence for, for rossperotredux, does trump stand, as moderate but, …, toward not, less bannonish claremalone, as hell, could have a, t after it, strongly disapprove of, role he s, trump whoever the, the narrative of, group, guess steve bannon, m gon na, the north and, more time, but the, might be the, ah, is the us, then we ll, harry more, bigger question, marco, both more, for kasich s, yeah …, but it, to do, next time around, if president trump, s generic as, republican natesilver yeah, i ask, departure clare you, one more, alienate the people, answer 0, one more time, m sure some, sure we ever, some of them, pence and his, couple of, hoping that they, lukewarm on him, him and, micah this, but let, website breitbart, clare malone, that backs up, that s immigration, today we re, just look, tbh claremalone, on trump, about bannon …, i might call, didn t buy, for better, the point, media last, and more, a mike pence, conventional leader, guess, candidate who, departure clare, the man doesn, time we, sure how, maybe they, who oppose trump, marco rubio for, below has, – definitely vote, he s sort, midwest is, of people who, trump stand with, for him, same as they, president trump will, why mr, going to do, longterm success, … among trump, people nervous who, way president, avenue, in the best, exit poll, agree with clare, he isn t, doing worse, sure we, president pence, influence 49, transcript below, on pence and, as they, after trump, and midwest is, president so they, think pence, skip straight to, thing to me, speech in, it ok, m so glad, micah boring, a higher percentage, impact of bannon, voters want in, a moderate democrat, voter natesilver, marco rubio, comparison pence s, charlottesville and, and aug 21, no answer 0, wasn t, to resign, popular vote, claremalone trump could, republican party and, the trump, think pence would, both reluctant trump, talk, want someone anyone, than worse natesilver, it is, interesting claremalone it, gon na, enough influence 21, s sort, amount, different than president, political writer, interviewed aug 1821, different and, part because, right

this question, poll, harry, outweigh the, the other, claremalone so 45, than worse, or disapprove of, and not, role, leader than trump, trump, comparison pence, from 15 percent, trump right direction, quite sure, voted for trump, interesting claremalone, trump could, this is, the biggest fan, with clare you, who like pence, fan of the, that this survey, – 2, to the are, was 61 percent, na give us,
