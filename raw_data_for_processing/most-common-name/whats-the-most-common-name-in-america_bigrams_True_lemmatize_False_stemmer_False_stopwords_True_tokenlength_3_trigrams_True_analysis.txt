the overall white, and ditto for, garcia the hispanic, those named garcia, garcia grew the, the overall hispanic, this caused major, major reshuffling the, surnames because the, because the hispanic,

americans have ahead, now the tricky, bit turned those, them the total, number people the, showed that the, being called michael, surname smith 100, figure out the, just multiplied those, two get 0008, you rarely hear, hear say this, still crap even, after all those, those adjustments for, assumes that you, that you can, treat person first, and last name, last name independent, but guessing the, americans with particular, with particular first, like rolling two, illustrate the point, let use the, use the most, last names the, just multiply the, each those you, get neat little, this the first, and most important, wrong that basic, that basic demographic, tie certain first, names together know, equally distributed among, americans because the, surnames with breakdown, with breakdown racial, heimerl were white, and 990 percent, rezendiz were hispanic, were hispanic those, facts affect first, too intuitively you, that there are, maria martinez than, miller last year, last year lee,

table, table using ssa, using ssa and, records looks little, does show just, how strong those, strong those racial, racial and ethnic, are take the, take the first, last name rodriguez, assume the likelihood, independent then the, the chance american, being named thomas, rodriguez about 0000019, and there would, searching whitepagescom though, number people the, name was percent, than the basic, would suggest you, suggest you can, just how much, and underestimate the, prevalence any particular, name using hartman, using hartman matrix, there are other, chart that reveal, assume names can, can together any, americans called john, far lower than, would suggest even, even less bold, bold alliterations such, davis appear unpopular, appear unpopular among, were extend the, extend the

adjusted our, simple estimates the, most likely name, into account hartman, hartman research which, are more and, less likely than, likely than basic, smith dropped down, most likely name, likely name
