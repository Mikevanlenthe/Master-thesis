1910, associate professor emeritus, so i m, an american being, andrew, having the surname, s first name, breakdown of, north yorkshire, changed a, step to account, to try, number of, reality he,

after all, while the share, lot more, rodriguez is, you ll, dear, to use, called michael, calculation it was, you d better, have changed a, in america but, the name, reckon you, diverse almost, no matter, dear kieron well, to dearmona, to the, want a list, for this we, administration, rodriguez searching on, most common surname, just how, here s, off to, more straightforward database, rank as no, footnotes1, then and, ditto for, combinations in the, column this, name like john, little different from, included in the, this we, american nomenclature, as the overall, corrects for the, do with, a different conclusion, calculated a correction, full name, us population, in and, s data set, distribution, history but, lee hartman, an associate, were able to, then calculated a, parent, just how bad, lot of time, name kieron george, detail is, same rate, surname by a, common name in, maria and, mile, ditto for garcia, and the last, little different, are 024 people, population then, so for example, davis thomas, explain, the most, in 2000 999, dividing them by, can t be, rodriguez as, much slower rate, how much more, that a computer, together in, johnson david, white population which, period, idea it, more common the, certain last name, captured reality he, just multiply, because the census, full name and, the overall, the country s, each year since, third most, the list beyond, by taking into, data at datamostcommonname, phone book than, hispanic share of, thomas and the, reality it, it s, being called michael, you d be, baby, this period, databases one, is the third, as mark martin, to be younger, are still, a lot faster, book than simple, in this column, d expect, first and most, suggest as a, of the population, figure out how, to a problem, security, blandness, back to, s how, tried to test, than 50, top 10, top 1000, description so, white while the, in reality it, methodology is, racial and, john isn, statistical step to, different conclusion, popular first name, example the, their baby, half the country, correction factor, a question, it ahead of, particular first and, matrix below, have a given, go together in, percent of, would like, or to, breakdown, count them too, each surname3 it, it no, almost 30 percent, top 1000 mostcommon, a clichéd, percent lower, so if, in history but, is a real, brittany tend, past 14, share, reason this, hispanic and latino, s say smith, the population wasn, in the, correction, nothing to, from the 97th, s research on, look, illustrate the, that calculation it, with that name, second place and, nomenclature, population wasn, as of 2013, in the phonebook, website and see, focusing on, hope, common first, in america, clichéd byname, t independent, lot, headscratcher not, to account, even make it, illustration by joel, data at, it to, and the, kieron george, and latino, joel, lower than simple, and in the, in the population, the ssa s, plosz dear mona, in america by, a problem, probabilities captured reality, percent hispanic we, diffuse, based on how, thomas rodriguez, time and money, million with the, about 74 percent, there are, then the, extend the list, more sophisticated technique, just over 1, hartman didn, this way, show, and ethnic group, country if you, surname smith, the adjusted ssa, data to, total number of, prevalence of any, state, smiths grew since, is about, in the data, daniel davis, hispanic or latino, a correction, for example, census, idea, help kieron george, hartman found, let s say, is to, hispanic, my colleague, male, lee hartman an, miller, first name and, then able to, to adjust the, about 0000019 percent, with each, off to a, highly misleading chart, by the, this is a, most common full, a result, tip, a daughter, imaginative when, mine rose and, a mile is, back to 1880, by racial and, chunk, to assume, for the nsa, we then, by mona, full name in, smith, to the 15th, the social security, i reckon, for example the, mine, ahead of, so i, name in, the white, most important reason, say smith we, at the overall, the footnotes1, in 1880 is, can see just, surname garcia is, list, likely name in, change my surname, such as mark, than basic probability, adjust the number, chances of, in the top, grew since 2000, blandness so, from the most, a certain last, filed under hope, surname heimerl, have a question, wrong is, i don, the 1746, year lee, name4 so, a much slower, colleague andrew, first name thomas, and population growth, the past, go for, common they, in the us, those you get, to do, of which, by joel plosz, mile is smith, is 08, your name, count, are a, who live in, which presents a, american being, group it, be about 5940, latino, was in, the top 1000, get 0008, as no 74, bit, tried to, factor in ethnicity, you get, instance, two to, ssa data to, more and less, dropped down from, the distribution, reveal, an idea, gem, crap and, the top 20, to factor in, adjusted our simple, minnie in, assume, ethnic group, nothing to do, result michael smith, associate, live in, than 50 percent, name and last, the point let, when they, a double blow, different from, hispanic we, and last, to illustrate, foreignborn population, at datamostcommonname, in ethnicity, book than, really the most, chalabi and, for each, the last, to change, least because if, history but also, alive today, million americans have, population growth, the surname johnson, order, maria garcia was, top 100, grew at, click, hispanic population, in the country, crap even after, probabilities maria garcia, this column, computer even one, more than, column this methodology, nate, let, tend to, get a, didn t, garcia grew, intuition hartman, growth it, rose and in, the chance, come in and, from being not, smith is about, more than you, name combination, with your name, also a placeholder, chunk of people, set maria and, our simple, reflected in the, to our github, fit either description, list beyond the, very diverse almost, in the past, as though they, beyond the, state as of, smith we just, ssa s database, like john isn, suffer a, garcia is 91, real headscratcher, come in, at the same, in each, martin, reveal just, tricky bit, choose the top, minnie in 1880, grew since, related to each, database, methodology when he, that the number, no matter how, the country if, certain last, group, thomas rodriguez is, can treat a, at 737 am, going to try, dearmona fivethirtyeightcom, t fit either, in and out, over 1 percent, time for instance, probably doesn t, what s the, almost half, the footnotes1 this, that nine of, age, plosz illustration, any order, moved up from, dearmona fivethirtyeightcom or, white and, the country, searching on whitepagescom, the proportional share, minnie, which was just, we just, it was last, t detect as, unique mona and, event that i, them too, to count, combination, even one, immigration, a placeholder, to piece, expected to be, fivethirtyeightcom or datalab538, a correction factor, estimate, help, placeholder, hartman an associate, blow, since 2000, was just, percent fewer, can treat, the ssa, percent with the, send it to, a person, mark martin and, reason this is, smith is, make sure, out the probability, like this the, daughter of, money or work, little and, to factor, to move over, joel plosz dear, nothing, yorkshire, computer, name, john isn t, ditto, garcia grew at, distribution of, population which, hispanic or, how we got, change, by joel, like this, ssa has a, datalab538, hartman didn t, record, of baby, would suggest as, foreignborn population we, a given name, combination overall we, a placeholder name, with the surname, can go together, share of those, of time and, too for example, you d expect, population we, the census bureau, independent of, that reveal just, set maria, be the, thomas or william, out how, a simple idea, if you, guessing the number, that the chance, factor in, description, davis appear to, the us, illustration, change my, with each other, census bureau has, america might very, hispanic those, answer my colleague, babies christened minnie, took one, straightforward database, taking into account, think the, the hispanic population, we took one, out of fashion, prevalence of, common name kieron, likelihood, uk dear kieron, i tried a, is john smith, hartman an, idea look up, be more, it is to, wouldn t go, chance of, lott no, my surname i, southern illinois university, that name4 so, of spanish at, professor emeritus of, history, typical age of, john smith of, chance of an, example, last name let, rodriguez, the hispanic share, the 354th, percent and, two separate, am dear mona, test that intuition, in 100 and, person s, to do with, found out how, hispanic rate, ssa and census, website and, s database of, called michael is, in the ssa, a huge figure, common full name, with each surname3, at datamostcommonname illustration, miller last, question you, fit either, as i ll, name in america, doesn t, rate as, the census, proportional share, the us population, country, wired to factor, treat a, bad an, don t fit, more diffuse, and money or, we needed a, reality he found, mona and, maria smith, t be, mile is, daughter, tends to be, population, here send it, of the, methodology, overall we, reshuffling of, name let, too and, data as a, a bit easier, varying popularity of, slower rate, america but, breakdown of the, in each state, very diverse, factoring in life, the white population, become a clichéd, rate america, surname, sadly none of, description so i, the surname rezendiz, security administration, you can see, first and last, dearmona, today, changed a lot, smith 25 million, and money, suggest as, it was, reflected in, wasn t born, the top, davis thomas thomas, john johnson, a
