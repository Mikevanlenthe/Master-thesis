say, mine, or work, growth, maria smith, my colleague, by focusing, the mark, that the chance, have changed a, while the share, for death, the list, were white and, t independent, each year since, s the most, that in 2000, surname garcia is, with your name, john smith, pages website and, the country, s research, more common, surname3 it, no matter, description, people in, to expand, our analysis, is a real, here s, reshuffling of, at datamostcommonname illustration, name like john, the end, have a given, event that i, common the, more sophisticated technique, just about, and see, it no matter,

common name, our simple, combination, lower than the, have either a, you can treat, american first, period, be younger, in america but, on life expectancy, of the population, rezendiz, like john isn, more diffuse or, plan, simply couldn t, were able to, rolling two dice, grew at the, github page hope, for lott, use, this we, plosz illustration, rate this, presents a problem, percent fewer in, intuition hartman, it to, security, name combination, event, population we took, common surname, but as i, the surname, in and, the top 20, million with the, tend to, that name, tried to figure, and maria, send it to, likely name in, the footnotes1 this, the first name, a lot of, little different from, get 0008, half the, in life, smith, wouldn t, almost 30 percent, more than 50, grew a lot,
